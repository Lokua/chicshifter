<p>Since the majority of my wardrobe is cotton, wool, and linen, it wasn’t overly challenging for me to adhere to the limits of Fabric Shifter. What was more challenging — and rewarding — was simply being acutely aware of what I was wearing and noticing how my personal style has changed over the past year since graduating from art school. </p>  

<p>When I started working as a writer in the tech industry, I began to notice that women in that world often seem to have only one of two choices deemed “professional”: Ann Taylor LOFT office wear or hoodies with jeans. I refuse to adhere to either of those, and instead wear biker boots and oversized silhouettes to work (to the applause of my co-workers). And I still stick by my personal rule: I refuse to work anywhere that won’t allow me to wear a miniskirt on the job. </p>
