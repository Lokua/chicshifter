<h2>Spring/Summer Issue</h2>

<h1>“The Four R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Revive, Risk”</h1>

<p>On a summer trip to the Adriatic coast in 1982, my mother had purchased
several lovely dresses for me, all of which I adamantly refused to put
on in favor of shorts and a t-shirt. My mother laughs and recalls that
it was at this moment when she understood she couldn’t tell me what to
wear, and has never tried to again. My initial refusal to wear dresses
led to a later phase at the age of five of only wearing dresses with
pants, a trusted ensemble that I still revert back to as a
thirty-something.</p>

<p>Although I was never skilled with needle and thread for making clothes
or pencil for sketching them, clothes and fashion have always been
integral to my understanding of self and others. However, despite my
love for fashion, mainstream fashion publications never fully engaged my
fashion sensibilities. Until I found <em>WORN</em> <em>Fashion Journal</em>, a
Canadian fashion magazine devoted to celebrating fashion for those that
love fashion but hate mainstream fashion magazines. Unfortunately, I
discovered it too late, as it had already gone out of print in 2014.
Thus, I am creating <em>Chic Shifter</em> in this same rebellious spirit.</p>

<p>Likewise, books such as <em>Women in Clothes</em> and <em>Fear and Clothing</em> have
shown me that I am not alone in my desire for critical dialogue about
fashion. Roland Barthes, Georg Simmel, Adolf Loos, Jean Baudrillard, and
<em>Fashion Theory Journal</em> also raise important questions about fashion
theory and clothing that I will address within <em>Chic Shifter</em> with the
desire to foster further conversation.</p>

<p>It is my hope that <em>Chic Shifter</em> will support a community of
Midwesterners who are interested in learning about local designers,
fashion exhibits, personal style and larger issues in the fashion world.
As a Chicagoan, I have always respected and loved the working-class
character of the city. Chicago is a tough city, the harsh weather can
harden and invigorate. While the Chicago fashion sense tends to be
defined as utilitarian, sensible, and comfortable; there are often
careful details under the layers that play into a Midwestern aesthetic.</p>

<p><em>Chic</em> Shifter is released biannually in keeping with a move towards the
notion of a slow fashion. This first issue for Spring/Summer, focused on
“Four R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Renew, Risk” tackles issues of sustainability,
conscious consumption, and the cyclical versus innovative nature of
fashion. These four R’s are essential in considering Spring/Summer
fashions as we shed layers of protection from the fall and winter and
move forward.</p>

<p>A <em>chic shifter</em> works to shift fashion from just a consumer’s passing
folly to a thoughtful and concerned passion. Loving and supporting
Chicago fashion, and that of the Midwest, <em>Chic Shifter</em> carves out a
space for fashion criticism, and praise, all while dressed in whimsy and
wit.</p>
