# Case for Slow Fashion: Considering fibers
## by Ana Sekler

Much is being said of an existential crisis in the fashion world these days. A recent article in Women’s Wear Daily by Bridget Foley, said, “It feels as if fashion is on one giant collision course with itself and everyone’s talking about it, designers included.” The elements that define this collision course are as wide and varied as any season’s color spectrum. Such a large issue cannot be tackled in one fell swoop, so this is first in a series of cases for slow fashion where I will outline various regions of the fashion industry, from production to consumption in order to gain a better understanding in making personal choices as regards the purchase of garments.

The first thing to consider in the chain is production, and by that I mean the fiber itself as that will effect and be affected by the rest of the cycle. For me, it seems like a logical starting point in this vast world of clothing. According to Kate Fletcher’s statistics from 2008, in her book Sustainable Fashion and Textiles: Design Journeys, the two fibers dominating the market are cotton 25.10%, and polyester 36.46%. Overall manufactured fibers, like polyester, nylon, and acrylic, and are on top. But this is not an easy answer of natural fibers are better for the environment so those must be the ones to cultivate. It is a mixture of the two, as each has its positives and negatives.

I had always thought that buying natural fibers, like cotton was the best choice for the environment, but that is not necessarily the case. The hike in productivity and pesticides applied to cotton are strongly correlated with negative environmental impacts like reduced soil fertility, loss of biodiversity, water pollution and severe health problems (footnote, how do I note this?) While irrigated cotton may require more water for growth than polyester and other synthetics, these synthetics in turn require more energy.

Fletcher proposes a diversification of material in order to achieve a level of harmony. “This strategy of materials diversity involves replacing some of the dominant or high-impact fibres with alternatives including low-chemical and organic cotton, hemp, lyocell, wool and PLA,” says Fletcher. Lyocell is a cellulosic fiber made from wood pulp, it was developed in the 1980s and is claimed as environmentally responsible, although it is an energy intensive fiber. PLA is unlike conventional synthetics in that it is made from renewable sources, presently corn, and is compostable, unlike polyester, which is made from fossil fuels and non-biodegradable.  

These alternatives generally yield a low energy and low water usage percentage as compared to conventionally grown cotton or synthetics like acrylic and viscose. It’s handy to always remember to read the label of garments before purchase. Something may feel soft and lovely, like much acrylic is meant to resemble wool, but often times not only is the fiber a poor alternative to wool for example, but the price is often comparable and the quality not as enduring. I have a long wool cardigan and an acrylic one, both are soft and warm, but whenever I wear the acrylic one it creates a lot of static electricity, and often creates little bubbles of the fiber on the outside that must be removed, while also attracting pieces of the fiber that it covers. So if I wear said cardigan over black jeans, the inside of the cardigan will have a slight black tinge to it due to the mixing of the materials. The wool cardigan doesn’t suffer from this and will likely be a staple in my closet for years to come.

I don’t mean to overwhelm with many numbers and figures, but it is important to know the data in order to make decisions as wearers of garments have the choice to decide what to buy. How much of this is the production, and how much the consumption? If we simply make a concerted effort to slow ourselves down by reading the label and considering the fabric than that will in turn dictate the supply, less demand for a given type of fabric will eventually lead to a decrease in supply of it.
