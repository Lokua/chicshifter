<p>  On the first day I just wore a patterned dress, so I didn't have to think about putting colors together. The other four days I wore top/bottom combinations that I had never put together before. In that way, this limit felt like an expansion. I think it's easy for me to wear one color and one neutral. I like how weeks two and three pushed me out of that mentality. </p>
