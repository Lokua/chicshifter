<p>If the large wiry mesh sphere, resembling an immense rubber band ball were the only marker to Robin Richman’s eponymous boutique, that would be enough. Much of the clothing, accessories, and jewelry inside Robin Richman evokes this sculpture. Garments from around the globe, outwardly fragile barrettes, and bracelets and earrings from various metals stand as relations of the sculpture that hangs outside of the unassuming storefront.</p>
<p>In business for almost 20 years, the shop opened in 1997, Robin Richman’s selections resonate with a particular type of customer who is interested in unconventional and daring fashions.  Richman whose welcoming smile and spirited disposition was not something I initially associated with the owner of an avant-garde clothing boutique, vaguely remembered me from Andrea Reynders’ trunk show in November and agreed to let me take photos of her unique space. Richman was herself a designer of chunky, hand-knit accessories for 18 years, after having studied textiles at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Today, she curates and owns, what is easily the hottest boutique in Chicago.</p>
<p>The boutique carries men’s and women’s clothing from obscure designers none of whom I was familiar with but if my wallet allowed I would love to get to know them. The first piece that struck me upon entrance, was a blush colored tunic from Eckhaus Latta, designers from New York. The garment is called Powder Smock and can be worn as a tunic or dress, long-sleeved and perfect for transitional seasons like spring. Made in the USA is a rarity these days, but this smock is a prime example of what quality workmanship from innovative designs can be in the USA. The price tag, like most at the boutique is hefty, $388 for the Powder Smock, but if price isn’t a consideration, then better to spend at Robin Richman than any shop on North Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p>As I had been in to the shop once before, in November for Andrea Reynders’ trunk show, I knew which items were at my price point, vintage French barrettes in a glass case by the cash register. I quickly located a pink lucite barrette to match my springtime punky hair and mood When the barrette was 20% off for a spring sale, I thought, well today’s my lucky day. The comment the shop assistant made to me after I had chosen the barrette cemented my belief in my newfound state of luck. “You may have heard it before, but you look a bit like Charlotte Gainsbourg,” she said.  I laughed and said that I had heard it before, but not for some time, and it was an honor to hear this comparison. Floating on the wings of the Gainsbourg legacy, I continued my exploration of this shop which can feel like a cultural museum as every piece is so carefully chosen, cared for, and maintained.</p>
<p>A small curio cabinet of exquisitely colored glass rings and other jewels stands near the threshold that separates the men’s clothing from the women’s. In the men’s section, the colors were darker, the materials still lightweight. The arrangement throughout the shop forces one to stop and take in entire sections, as they are made for looking, standing back to appreciate the way one does at a museum or art gallery. I was forced to stop and stare at a Walter Van Bierendonck men’s shirt, printed all over with tiny red, pink, and blue mushrooms, priced at $298. Colored into this wonder of a men’s shirt, I got lost in the fairytale and only snapped out of it when Richman walked by and commented that she loved my blue suede boots. Speaking of boots, there are several amazing pairs of shoes by Guidi. Faint pink front-zip boots, and open-toed oxfords of the same shade.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about a 1991 Wim Wenders’ documentary about the Japanese clothes designer Yohji Yamamoto, Notebook on Cities and Clothes. In it, Yamamoto described how he liked to look at the photos in August Sander’s book Citizens of the Twentieth Century because he thought you could match the person’s profession to their clothing. I since checked out the book to see what he was talking about and it’s true. The section on manufacturers for example, the men who share this profession resemble one another, the farmers too, the artists also, and so on.</p>
<p>While at Robin Richman, I wondered how the women and men who wore these garments would be labeled in a book on citizens of the twenty-first century, so I decided to pretend if income wasn’t a concern in profession, what some garments alluded to. I think most certainly the Powder Smock would be worn by an artist, a dancer, perhaps a writer. The Barbara Bologna Fly Print dress which is worn like a superhero’s cape, with the back left to fly loose, would belong to category of mother, mostly due to the ease of mobility that mothers need. The men’s mushroom shirt would have to belong to a farmer, a scientist, or a psychologist. Guessing games aside, this boutique is meant for perusing, smiling at the whimsical clothes, and remembering that we are what we wear, so let’s choose wisely as citizens of the twenty-first century.</p>
