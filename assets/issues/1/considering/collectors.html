<h1>Les collectionneurs /The collectors</h1>
<h3>By Ana Nezna</h3>
<p>Ever since reading <em>Women in Clothes</em>, a book that sets out to examine
not what women wear but the reasoning behind their choices, I’ve been
more attentive to my own clothing behaviors.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of essays, conversations, photographs, and
surveys from more than 600 women. The authors, Sheila Heti, Heidi
Julavits, and Leanne Shapton sent out questionnaires to hundreds of
women asking them a range of questions from “What is your cultural
background and how has that influenced how you dress?” to “Are there any
clothing (or related) items that you have in multiple?” The women who
contributed to the book include Cindy Sherman, Lena Dunham, Kim Gordon,
Tavi Gevinson, and Miranda July.</p>
<p>One section that I particularly enjoyed was “Collections”, a page of
photographs devoted to documenting what various women collected, ranging
from tote bags and nail polish to jean jackets and leopard-print tops.
The collections were never discussed in any detail, but the pictures
were so lovely to look at, nine gray sweatshirts, ten pairs of marled
socks, thirteen navy blazers, alike and different in their own ways. It
got me thinking about my own collections, was there a clothing item that
I had in multiple?</p>
<p>I didn’t have to think long as I immediately remembered my own
collection of striped shirts, mainly long-sleeve, a few short-sleeved, a
collection I shared with one of the authors, Heidi Julavits. This led me
to an endless list of questions: Why the striped shirts? When did I
start collecting them? Why collect clothing? What do people in my social
circle collect? Are collections treated differently from singular items?
Do I care for my striped shirts more carefully than my one red dotted
t-shirt?</p>
<p>Everyone collects, it’s a human activity. Eric Rohmer’s, Haydée, in the
film <em>La Collectionneuse</em>, collected lovers. In a 2014 article from <em>The
Guardian</em>, “Why do we collect things? Love, anxiety, or desire”,
Christian Jarrett, psychologist and author of <em>The Rough Guide to
Psychology</em>, says “One psychoanalytical explanation for collecting is
that unloved children learn to seek comfort in accumulating belongings;
another is that collecting is motivated by existential anxieties – the
collection, an extension of our identity, lives on, even though we do
not. More recently, evolutionary theorists suggested that a collection
was a way for a man to attract potential mates by signalling his ability
to accumulate resources.”</p>
<p>Jean Baudrillard addressed collecting in his seminal text, <em>The System
of Objects</em>. He describes collecting as a type of organization in
response to the ambiguity of our ordinary environment. “Collecting,
however, offers a model here: through collecting, the passionate pursuit
of possession finds fulfillment and the everyday prose of objects is
transformed into poetry, with triumphant unconscious discourse.” He
cites Maurice Rheims in likening collection to a “passionate game.” In
thinking about my own collection of striped shirts, I could understand
that I was not just seeking out any striped shirt, but that this
collection had grown to be passionate in the sense that the shirts that
made it into the collection were special, and somehow heroic.</p>
<p>Inspired by <em>Women in Clothes</em>, I sent out a brief questionnaire to
several friends, asking them what they collected, when they began
collecting, why this particular item and if possible to provide a photo
of their collections. Three friends responded.</p>
<p>Chris Roberts, former artist formerly of Chicago, currently lives in
Oakland, CA is a collector. I know him as a collector of sunglasses so I
was sure he would report on that but he responded with another of his
trademark items: the golfer cap. He’s been collecting them since 1997
and says, “once I found my style, I just kept it.” Roberts who says he’s
often cold, needs the caps for warmth. He doesn’t take any special care
of them, and says “usually once they start to smell they are used less
in the rotation until they are phased out.” The caps are of varying
material, lighter cotton ones for the warmer months, and wool ones for
colder weather, but always the same style. The patterns vary as well,
mainly plaid patterns although some are solid. Roberts will often take
the time to modify the size if necessary by carefully stitching a fold
in the back so that they fit him just right.</p>
<p>Dijana Savic, who lives and works in Paris, collects crochet pieces, a
collection that she inherited from her mom and aunts. Her grandmother
crocheted the tops and dresses that were eventually passed down to
Dijana and her sister. This inherited collection led her to seek out
more crocheted pieces, and she says, “there is something so elegant and
enchanting about these hand made pieces and details.” When it comes to
caring for these items, Dijana is very attentive. “There are certain
pieces that are more resistant and durable, and therefore, I do wear
them more often.  However, the crochet dress is a rarity - it&#39;s for
particular occasions.” Even with the crochet tops, which she wears more
regularly, Dijana likens wearing them to a “ceremonious occasion.” This
is perhaps due to the nostalgic effect that these pieces play, being
that her mother once wore them, which reminds me of another great
section from <em>Women in Clothes</em>, “Mothers as Others”.</p>
<p>In this section, women were asked to send photographs of their mothers
from the time before they had children and describe what they saw.
Author, Sheila Heti said this of her mother’s photo, “That dress is
great. I’m always looking for dresses like that. I move like my mother
and have her body­––especially her feet and hands. It troubled me when I
noticed it as a girl, but now it makes me feel warm and closer to her.”
I have felt this many times looking at pictures of my own mother before
she was a mother, and wishing she had saved this dress, those jeans, or
that scarf. Dijana’s collection reminds us of the potential depth of
clothing, when it is not viewed as simply superficial items of mindless
consumption.</p>
<p>Chicago-based, interior stylist Emily Grant had a much more lightweight
collection, tights, which she has collected for about ten years. Emily
collects tights because they are “inexpensive and can change the look of
any dress or skirt.”</p>
<p>And finally, there is my own collection of striped shirts in varying
colors and sleeve-lengths. I’ve been collecting them since 2008 and
initially they were only long-sleeved striped shirts due to Chicago
weather, but recently I’ve acquired a few with short-sleeves. A strict
requirement for them is that they are made from 100% cotton. Colors and
stripe thickness can vary.</p>
<p>I think I seek this item out because I’ve watched too many Godard films
and have been influenced by the fashions in them. But honestly, I enjoy
prints in clothing, and stripes are an easy one to mix with other
prints, like flowers. I do take special care to preserve these items.
One Sonia Rykiel striped top that was perhaps one of the first in this
collection, I have patched the hole in the elbow so that I can continue
to wear it. I try to rotate them so that the old ones can live longer
while the younger ones get more usage.</p>
<p>But in the end, they are clothes and will fall apart and that is one
thing that I value more than any collection, the ability to say goodbye
to an item and move on. My mother didn’t save the dresses and jeans that
I drool over in photos from her youth. She didn’t bother packing all her
clothes or mine each time that we moved. Instead, she taught me how to
value my clothes while at the same time understand what was no longer
necessary. It’s these skills of selection and necessity that have helped
me navigate through the sea of striped shirts that are being sold and
pick just one or ignore them all until the one I really want sails along
or goes on sale, whichever comes first.</p>
