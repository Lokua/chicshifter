There is a little known storehouse of creativity that sits atop the historic Macy’s building on State Street known as the Chicago Fashion Incubator (CFI). The elevators up to the incubator sit behind the Swarovski counter, and although they say for employees only, I followed the instructions that the incubator’s Design Director Andrea Reynders had given me up to the eleventh floor, which houses the incubator and Macy’s administrative offices.

Reynders greeted me in the lobby and walked me down the long hallway to the southeast end of the building, where the incubator spaces were. Andrea Reynders is Professor Emeritus at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she also earned her BFA and was the former Sage Endowed Chair of Fashion Design. She began working on the board of the Chicago Fashion Incubator when a former student, Lara Miller who was then executive director of CFI, asked her to join in 2010. When Miller left to focus on her own clothing line, Reynders took over officially as Design Director and mentor in 2014. “I felt when I had looked at the designs of the incubator designers, they needed to be a little more challenged and make stronger collections. I also really felt strongly about changing the program from a one year to a two-year program,” says Reynders.  At the same time, the board decided to hire Trideep Das, who was also appointed co-chairperson for the Mayor’s Fashion Council, as Business Director.

“Chicago has a history of manufacturing, but it was primarily before during and slightly after World War II that it was at its height, doing a lot of womenswear manufacturing. All of those loft buildings that are now converted into residences, down around Canal and Clinton, those all housed manufacturing centers. My mother was a part of that, she and my aunts all worked down there,” recalls Reynders. That history was somehow forgotten, until believe it or not, former Mayor Daley who began his fashion initiative in 2005, CFI was one of the products of this endeavor. “When Mayor Daley started the incubator back in 2007, he had hoped to bring up more manufacturing, make it alive again, make it a center, providing more jobs for people and making it a potential place for designers to stay longer here or to really create their businesses,” says Reynders.

The two-year program provides six fledgling designers with the resources to bridge the gap from fashion students to fashion entrepreneurs. CFI supports the designers by offering them a workspace, shared offices, and a curriculum of business and creative workshops, and mentoring. “Coming from a strong art and design background, there was virtually no business knowledge, so understanding my consumer, how to do a competitors grid, understanding the ins and outs of that, I’m learning all that” says Shruti Kriti, who is in her first-year at the incubator.

The designers who have varied focuses: three in womenswear, two in bridal, and one in swimwear, each develop two collections during their time at the incubator. Kriti, who was a student of Reynder’s at SAIC, began the program in March 2015, and is working on her fall/winter 2016 collection, which concentrates on career wear with functionality. “Your clothes really have to carry you through the day, so I’m working with a specific fabric that’s referred to as scuba, it doesn’t wrinkle or stretch easily but is comfortable and soft, and it adds a little funkiness to career wear,” says Kriti.

Midwestern cities like Chicago often have a hard time of keeping their designers, not due to the lack of creative energy but more so to the lack of manufacturing. Recalling, the early strength of the Apparel Industry Board of Illinois (AIBI) in the 1970s, Reynders says, “that organization was very powerful at some point, and they even built what was the garment center, right next door to the Merchandise Mart. Their dream was to bring buyers to Chicago, and it worked for a couple of years, because people were curious and interested. The point was to build up Chicago, but it was a big struggle, and I believe primarily due to the manufacturing, couldn’t start the fire under it, it would always smolder out.” Today, with organizations like CFI, Chicago is working to not only educate but also retain its local designers, like Shruti Kriti, who says “I want to grow this business here and use local resources, Midwestern is a compliment to me, that’s what I want it to be.” So far, Kriti has been successful, her fabric is sourced locally, and she has been able to locate a seamstress and photographer in Chicago, with the help of the incubator resources.

Being outside of a centralized fashion capital has advantages for emerging designers. “The Chicago market isn’t over saturated and we get to experiment and explore who we are as designers,” says Kriti. CFI supports its designers in various ways, with one-on-one mentoring, trunk shows, and practical business advice. “I tend to think of the Midwest as meat and potatoes, it’s serious about its work, we’re not flamboyant,” says Reynders. The incubator designers are always at work, whether cutting fabric for their patterns, organizing mood boards, or updating their websites. The life of a CFI fashion designer isn’t only about dress forms, fabric, and designs, a lot of footwork is involved. “Many of the designers in general get on the road, either they pack and fly to a city, make appointments with boutique owners, show their collections, sometimes there’s a trunk show involved,” explains Reynders.  

While the high-end fashion world seems to be moving at an unbelievably fast pace, creating not two but sometimes as many as twelve collections a year, and large fast-fashion retailers scrambling to keep up by making cheap imitations, it is refreshing and inspiring to visit the CFI. “I really think there’s something amazing that’s going to happen in fashion, there’s going to be a huge change and I feel it already. There are many small, independent designers in New York, California, Chicago, St. Louis who are making a really good product, trying to make it locally, or at least nationally,” says Reynders.   Bridget Foley’s article from October, in Women’s Wear Daily echoes Reynder’s sentiment. “It feels as if fashion is on one giant collision course with itself and everyone’s talking about it, designers included. While no one wants to turn back the clock (not possible, and reactionary doesn’t fly in fashion), many wonder—out loud—how to evolve (or perhaps revolutionize) the system in a way that makes sense,” says Foley in her article “Fashion’s Existential Crisis”. The responsibility is not only to the designer but perhaps even more so the consumer. Shruti Kriti laughs as she relates that she herself does not shop much, and advises the fast-fashion, trend hungry consumer, to simply “shop less!” This may be the key formula to creating a healthier relationship to fashion: shop less, and analyze more in order to develop personal style, while hopefully supporting the local and regional.
