<p>For someone who can barely stitch a straight line by hand, anything hand
sewn, embroidered, or made has always fascinated me. My hands do better
with less delicate tasks, like writing with a pen or keyboard, odd jobs
around the house, and of course piecing together the puzzles of Ikea
furniture. The women makers that form the boutique of Union Handmade are
women who are adept with their hands and creative minds. From the open
and closed sign that hangs on the door, carefully embroidered by Nancy
Melvin, to the dresses and shirts found inside the shop, Union Handmade
offers a truly unique boutique experience in a quiet neighborhood on the
north side of Chicago.</p>
<p>Browsing in Chicago boutiques is often a great way to enjoy a bit of the
outdoors while still being able to warm up when needed. Small business
Saturday was a sunny but brisk day last November, and seemed like an
appropriate day to go for a long walk and visit Union Handmade for the
second time. The boutique is run like a co-op, by its eleven members,
who all pitch in from welcoming customers behind the counter to
collaborating on projects with one another.</p>
<p>Union Handmade has been opened for two years now and provides a steady
collection of founder Leigh DeLeonardo’s airy jackets, dresses, tunics,
and coats alongside special-occasion dresses, handmade by Holly
Greenhagen, another Chicago designer. There are about fifteen different
designers represented at Union Handmade, mainly from the Midwest and
some from Brooklyn. From chunky knits to loose-fitting tunics, the
aesthetic oozes comfort, quality of fabric, and singularity in design.</p>
<p>The shop invites thoughtfully and quietly as all the senses are slowly
activated in the feel of the wools and other natural fibers, the sounds
of light music, and the sight of the clearly organized tables and racks.
Taste and smell were activated soon after entering when I was offered
warm apple cider and cookies. At this second visit I had a mission: a
chain necklace and circular pendant with an initial engraved for an old
friend’s upcoming birthday, at a reasonable price of $25. My belly full
and hands warmed up, I searched the jewelry table for the necklace. I
found the “J” initial I was searching for but it was in brass and I
needed the rosy colored pendant. Sure there were options I could’ve
gotten, reading “bestie” or “babe”, I’m sure my friend would’ve enjoyed
either but they simply didn’t satisfy my idea for the perfect birthday
gift.</p>
<p>The beauty of a boutique like Union Handmade is that you can talk to the
shop owner or designers directly. I mentioned to Leigh what I was
looking for and she said that it was no problem for her to call Katie
Mills or Lady Faye Jewelry, the designer, and ask if she had any “J”
pendants in her studio. Ten minutes later, everything was arranged, my
copper pendant with necklace from Lady Faye Jewelry would arrive the
following day. Experiences like this one help to create community, not
only does it sustain a community economically but it also fosters
solidarity, which kept me coming back to the shop for some springtime
visits as well.</p>
<p>On later visits to the shop, I grew more acquainted with the
specialities of the various designers. Although I had no plan for
purchasing as all of my clothing funds had gone towards a new dress in
celebration of completing my M.A. studies, I intended to select a few
choice items that I would hypothetically purchase, many of which I
photographed. I started from the back, with the rack of reduced items,
where my eyes fell upon a brown checked tunic or popover as it was
labeled, marked down to $69, by Auntie Oti. In 100% cotton khadi, a
hand-woven fabric made from hand-spun yarn from India, which is the
designer Susan Hahn’s emphasis. The popover was soft to the touch, and I
pictured it over jeans, or leggings, it was classic yet had this “Little
House on the Prairie” feel to it. As a lover of the television series
and Laura Ingalls Wilder books, this checked tunic could be worn
casually across concrete or grass fields.</p>
<p>Again on the reduced
rack, were two fluttery silk dresses from Nancy Melvin, from Habutai
silk, priced at $168, the luscious wine color and brighter lavender
were perfect for summertime strolling. Melvin’s label which reads “Made
Here” made me think about traveling, if I was in London with this same
dress, how would it read then? Undoubtedly the cleverest label I’ve
seen.</p>
<p>Moving away from the sale rack, I quickly began crushing on garments for
Leigh DeLeonardo’s collection and Union, her collaboration with Jamie
LaPorta. My first crush was the “Envelope” dress by Leigh DeLeonardo, a
linen wonder of a dress. It was in fact, like an envelope, with a button
seal in the back and another in the front, two basic methods of closure
that worked to create a bluish-gray beauty. Another favorite was the
Union folded skirt, at $143, a plaid cotton skirt, which may not sound
to appealing in words, but everything is in the details at Union
Handmade. Firstly, the plaid is small black and gray squares that are
cut through with orange lines, creating a vibrancy. The center fold
transforms the skirt from a skirt to a moving object, adding dimension
and interest.</p>
<p>Each time I go to this shop, I uncover some new layer, whether the
arrival of spring collections from the designers, or learning something
new about how one of the designers works and creates. Although the
majority of the price points are too high for me, the garments and
designers are deserving of them as they combine craftsmanship with
elegance.</p>
