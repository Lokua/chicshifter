Andrea Reynders is a real-time fashion designer, referring to the method of designing garments for a given season in the actual season. Many fashion designers choose to work this way or are making the choice to, some of the big-timers, like Tom Ford and Burberry have recently decided to shift to this type of scheduling. Prêt à porter will soon become not only ready to wear, but ready to buy.  The clothes appear on the runway, and are available immediately, leaving no time for fast-fashion retailers like Zara and H&M to copy designs and make cheap knock-offs for the upcoming season.  Reynders, who has been working this way for the majority of her collections, says that it works perfectly on a smaller scale.

In addition to working in real-time, her approach to fashion design is real and down-to-earth. She chooses distinct fabrics that cohabit the space of the body with their innovative design. Her fall/winter repurposed collection was chock full of gorgeous and hearty wools, cashmeres, and felt. At her trunk show in November at Robin Richman boutique in Bucktown, Reynders' love of winter was evident through the garments she was presenting. “I think that’s my favorite season because I love the volume, the thickness, and the heaviness of wool. Growing up in this part of the country, we need that kind of clothing, so I understand it, I appreciate it, and I like to work with it”, says Reynders. For this repurposed collection, Reynders scouts thrift stores and consignment shops to find cashmere sweaters, well-constructed jackets, which she then takes apart, cuts up, and puts together in order to create garments like the beige wool sweater that I fell in love with; the sleeves and pockets of a sturdy boiled wool, giving the sweater a structure and volume that permeates all of Reynders' designs.

Andrea Reynders, who is also the Design Director at the Chicago Fashion Incubator, and Professor Emeritus at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, bakes a fantastic pear pie. Arriving late to her home and studio in Woodstock, IL, I was greeted by her English Labrador, Becca, and Reynders, who was wearing a loose black dress, with an empire waist, over black trousers. After some pear pie, tea, and several petting sessions with Becca, we went downstairs to her studio to look at some garments from her fall/winter collection, and sketches and fabrics for the current spring/summer collection.  Reynders, who wears round, tortoise-shell glasses, the kind that recall French actresses of the sixties explained to me how important the lighting was in her new studio space. Since it lacks natural lighting, Reynders' husband located LED lights that simulate natural light, which make all the difference for garment design and construction. Her studio space is as simple and neat as the rest of her home, two large cutting tables take up the majority of the space, a sewing machine, dress forms, and a couple hanging racks stand off to the sides.

For her current collection, Reynders is working with lightweight fabrics like silk and nylon taffeta in navy, pewter gray, black, and she’s on the hunt for a few more colors. “I’m looking for a pure white, and a blush color, maybe an olive green. I’m looking personally for red, a really true red, and even if I don’t sell it, I’ll make something for myself,” says Reynders. For the fabrics, she will have to fly to New York for the weekend, as most local designers are limited by the scope of the Chicago market. In addition to the concern for the garment colors, many small designers like Reynders are limited because they must buy in small quantities. Although all of these considerations can be difficult, but Reynders’ approach to design makes these limits of the market insignificant as she works within her means.

Take the female body which changes shape so much through a woman’s life, up and down and all round or square, sometimes triangular or pentagonal. “I like to design in a way in which my clothes fit easily on people, that these clothes are comfortable enough that they can wear them always,” says Reynders. For example, she makes a skirt with a semi-wrap. “Part of it is sewn, but around the waist, it opens up all the way. It offers you an opportunity to move over those buttons if you need it tighter or looser. And people have loved that, that little bit of personalizing in the fit,” she explains. Many of the jackets from her fall collection have longer sleeves that can be cuffed up or left long to bundle the hands down in the harsh Midwestern Reynders is so familiar with and fond of.

In addition to creating clothes that grow with a person, another aspect of Reydners’ design philosophy evokes the slow movement in fashion that is gradually coming to the forefront. “I like to make clothes that I know people are going to put in their wardrobe and be happy with for years to come, that there is an endurance quality to them,” she says. This lack of trend chasing on Reynders part is indicative of her clients as well, who can be described as women who are more defined in what they want, who are willing to spend more on a coat that they know they will always have and want to wear. Reynders’ “Anya-Flip” coat is a prime example of the various elements behind her design philosophy.

The coat can be worn in two ways, as a shorter coat with two front pockets and a full collar that can be worn as a hood, to protect from a drizzle perhaps, or if it’s turned inside out and upside down, it becomes a longer coat, still with the two usable pockets. The version that I saw was in a rich black, made from a high-tech fiber, a well-made synthetic that is easily folded up. One of her best-selling garments, the coat can be made in various colors, and she has also made versions in wool. Whether working in natural fibers or modern synthetics, Reynders’ ability to understand and manipulate shape on the human form is astonishing as she creates a romance with color, texture, and volume.

 “Sometimes my process is about a solution to an event or something new to replace another article—but it is always about listening to the person and finding out what they want and making it even better. Today fashion is not about style dictation of a certain kind—rather enabling a discovery, a romance to happen between a garment and its wearer,” says Reynders of her approach to design. The trust that Reynders has built with her clients and within herself is evident in her expansive career, from her work designer to Professor Emeritus at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.


I’m slowly growing an affinity for some synthetic fibers after viewing some of Reynders’ collection. I was especially taken with and bewildered by a synthetic black taffeta from her upcoming spring collection that makes the most exquisite sound of rustling paper or leaves. It has movement and a crushable quality that allows for a large collar up or down or a variety of other choices, depending on her design, “I really believe in the slow movement in fashion, like from farm to table, from sewing machine to your body, it’s really important,” she says. Reynders, whose home is a renovated one-room schoolhouse, like her garments is repurposed and contemporary at the same time, classic and modern like the fabrics she chooses. Reynders thinks about the woman she designs for, not as a frivolous fashionista, but as conscious and reasonable women whose strength is only heightened by the garments they wear.
