<p>  For me, fabrics are a very situational and environmental choice. Luckily, I was in the desert for three days so I wore mostly cotton. If I had gone to work I imagine I would've pulled out a couple of silk shirts and my favorite wool pants. My day one outfit would've also worked well in the neutral or silhouette line-up!  </p>
