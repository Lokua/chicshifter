<p>My overall experience of this limit was great, I enjoyed changing my silhouette daily and for the most part I was able to wear my looks from day to night. For the first day I went with an oversized turtleneck and I paired it with my favorite black skinny jeans. Day two I went for my mesh bodysuit with wide leg pants and a kimono-like sweater.</p>

<p>I wanted to keep everything monochromatic but I added a pop of color with my electric blue suede boots.  On the third day I went with a dress that has embroidery and beading along the sleeves and ties at the waist creating an a-line look. By day four I was ready to wear my go to look, which is my long sleeve lace crop with a high waisted skirt. I like wearing this belt my sister bought me with this outfit.  The last day I chose a black fitted turtleneck and a black skirt with high top sneakers. Since I wear black every day, I like to polish my nails with a fun color and I always wear pink lipstick! I felt chic and comfortable every day.</p>
