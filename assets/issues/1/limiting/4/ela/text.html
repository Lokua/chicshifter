<p>This week was a big challenge, only natural fibers, materials, wool, and leather. In our contemporary world synthetics dominate and I am not a fan. They are mostly not breathable, and make you sweaty and itchy. I always try to buy clothes made from natural fibers. I like silk, and linen because they are breathable, soft and comfy. They are great in the summer. I canâ€™t imagine life without cotton. It is great in the summer and great in the winter. I love wool for its warmth. As accessories, I like the best silver jewelry. In my collection there are pink pearls, wood and fiber jewelry and a bunch of different types of minerals framed in silver. I enjoyed this week a lot, and I started thinking more about fibers and materials in my wardrobe. </p>
