<p>Fashion, like dance, belongs to the body. Both are separated from the
visual arts. In a 2007 article from <em>Fashion Theory</em> “Fashion as Art; is
Fashion Art?” Sanda Miller posits that, “we even have a category of
activities positioned at the interstices of the visual arts, including
dance, circus, clowns and culture, kitsch, nature, rain, personal
beauty, etc., which, like fashion, were not traditionally considered to
be art and thus subjects for aesthetics.” While dance has always been
considered one of the seven fine arts, this debate continues today with
regard to fashion. But designers like Katrin Schnabl, eschew it as there
is important work to do; she is a dancer, fashion designer, artist, and
educator.</p>
<p>Beginning as a dancer in her native Frankfurt, Germany, Schnabl made her
own costumes. “I thought every dancer made their own costumes, and it
was not until I came to New York that it became quite clear to me that
no, not every dancer has the same kind of energy about addressing what
needs to be on them in order to perform, and what I needed to do to
perform.” Her relationship with the body comes first from dance, from
considering how it navigates and engages with space to how it activates
that same space. She considers dance the first art; “it doesn’t need
language, it is very direct, it’s in time and in sync with the body, and
it happens here and now” she says.</p>
<p>Through her work with dance companies and avant-garde theaters in both
Frankfurt and the downtown dance scene of New York, she gained much
experience that continues to influence her design philosophy today. She
worked with a variety of body types, both male and female performers,
and most importantly learned what elements can be added to a dance,
without distracting, to help it read clearer. This particular idea
translates into her approach to fashion design. She is interested in
taking away from a garment, in allowing the garment to be worn, not to
be the one doing the wearing. “To me it’s a lot about what can you take
away before it collapses, like the Mikado game of pick-up sticks. The
dancers or wearer does so much, I don’t want to compete with or
overpower the wearer,” she says.</p>
<p>Speaking about the transition to fashion design, Schnabl recalls, “in an
interesting way you generate a lot of ideas and you vet them against
choreographic limitations, entrances and exits, from the bodies
themselves. You start with a lot and you narrow it down to relatively
little. So you have all of this leftover material, it may not have been
right for a particular dance, but in and by themselves they were pretty
cool, so I would start wearing them.” After taking a self-imposed
sabbatical from dancing, Schnabl enrolled in a draping class at the
Fashion Institute of Technology, which she enjoyed so much that she
ended up continuing on to receive her BFA in 1995.</p>
<p>Schnabl doesn’t speak about her design work in traditional terms of
collections from autumn/winter or spring/summer, but with more abstract
notions, choosing to address the ideas behind the garments. One of her
ideas about fabric, reminded me of my beginner level sewing class at
Vogue Fabrics several summers ago and wished that someone had told me
that when I was choosing a fabric for my pencil skirt. “I’m always
saying the hand picks the fabric, keep the eye off of it, because the
eye isn’t a good fabric picker, so the hand has to pick. The eye gets to
do a lot of other things,” she explains. I, however, picked the fabric
with my eye and ended up with an unstable pencil skirt. Schnabl however
knows her fabrics, “I think it’s a nice luxury that I’ve evolved
towards, I don’t want to work with fabrics that don’t feel good. At the
end of the day it ends up on the body, and it has to go through my hand,
cutting it and sewing it, why have a fabric that is not satisfying in
the process of making?, “she says.</p>
<p>Schnabl is attracted to the element of surprise in her work, a field
that she knows so well continues to offer nuances of discovery, much
like her garments did for me upon seeing them in motion. On the day we
met, she was wearing garments of her own making, from the soft white
jeans, to the sleeveless gray top, to the surprising tunic that turned
into a shop coat. When she stood up to show me how the dress functioned,
her dancing days were immediately visible; she is a tall, svelte woman
whose poised movements are those of a dancer. About the dress, Schnabl
says that she couldn’t make up her mind while draping, so she made it do
multiple things. It can be worn the way she initially had it on, more
like a vest or if tied a shop coat, or reversed and worn to the front
like a dress, a fascinating creation in a light gray with the tiniest
hints of orange.</p>
<p>These tiny hints of orange, or color more broadly is another important
consideration to Schnabl’s design aesthetic. “When it comes to color,
it’s the first thing you see, it really drives the emotion, you pick up
the color before you see the shape, definitely before you see the detail
and before you get close,” she says. Her use of color has grown to be a
brand signifier, people love that little bit of articulation, of
attention paid to the garment inside and out. Sometimes the color is
subtle, like on her gray tunic, where a strip of orange flashes out from
the inside or as another layer to her gray top. This direct use of vivid
color is evident in her spring/summer 2016 collection, where hues of
orange and blues pop. The week prior to the colors limit of Limiting
Chic, I perused Schnabl’s designs online and her use of color fortified
and excited me about the upcoming use of color imposed by the limit.</p>
<p>Currently, Schnabl is in the process of reexamining and shifting her
artistic practice as she considers moving away from the restrictions of
creating two collections a year. Her current atelier in Old Town is
being phased out. This studio space is where she and CEO and Co-Founder,
Birgit Rohm, have hosted numerous events for the fashion community.
Although these events were integral to the company and the broader
Chicago fashion public, Schnabl is interested in refocusing on design
and artistic collaborations. While she admits the challenges faced by
fashion designers in a non-fashion center like Chicago; from the loss of
manufacturing to a lack of resources and relevance; neither of the two
major newspapers pay fashion any mind.</p>
<p>She is using this time not only to shift potential modes of production,
but to reflect. “I want to explore how fashion can engage differently
within a place, I’m very passionate about my work and I’m interested in
what would truly be alternative modes of creating relationships through
fashion,” she says. Ultimately, better problems and questions are what
Schnabl is looking for, how to invest in the fashion moment, the Chicago
moment, to design the constellation within which the garment can exist
and have a complexity.</p>
<p>As far as getting to these moments, problems, questions, and
constellations through her design process, Schnabl quoted a French
proverb, “l’appétit vient en mangeant” (appetite comes with eating). By
designing, creativity grows and the practice evolves and progresses, so
she keeps some things unfinished, allowing the ideas to be harnessed for
a future collection. “There’s nothing I’d rather do in my life than go
to my studio and come up with an expression for a moment,” she says.</p>
