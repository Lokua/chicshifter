<p>Since Uniqlo, the Japanese clothing retailer landed in Chicago in October 2015, I have made a few trips up the escalator in the colorful glass box that houses the store.  A linen men’s shirt, two cotton t-shirts, a black fleece skirt, a basic button-down shirt, a v-neck, mock neck, and turtle neck merino sweaters, and a navy trench coat have made up my purchases. While initially excited about the prospect of casual sportswear at affordable prices in a range of colors, a seemingly perfect combination for the Midwest, I have quickly grown bored in the Uniqloset.</p>
<p>The navy trench is a favorite, along with the merino turtleneck and fleece skirt, but the more I read on fast fashion, in particular Elizabeth Cline’s Overdressed, the less I want to spend at these giant producers. Mainly because I am more concerned about the working conditions of the people making these garments and I am too skeptical to trust Uniqlo’s social responsibility promises found on their website. While I hope these few pieces last me a few more season, I am wary as the merino turtleneck has already started to show signs of wear. I have also grown more interested in supporting independent designers and am slowly steering myself away from large retailers.</p>
<p>The store sits in the space of the unforgettable bargain basement, Filene’s. At Filene’s the motto was to expect the unexpected. The racks could offer everything from a Dolce &amp; Gabbana white button-down to a Helmut Lang blazer, or just a hot mess. Joy or disappointment was part of the adventure of shopping at a store like Filene’s. The retail space, which has been empty since Filene’s closed in 2012, is now part of a new breed of shopping experience.</p>
<p>Founded in 1984 in Japan by Tadashi Yani, a Japanese businessman, one of the richest in Japan. Uniqlo is quickly catching up to the likes of H&amp;M, and Zara. With stores in 14 countries, Uniqlo is owned by Fast Retailing Co., Ltd., which also owns several other brands, like Theory and Comptoir des Cotonniers. Although a large retailer, Uniqlo sets itself apart from stores like H&amp;M and Zara by its attention to fabric while ignoring adherence to the latest trends. While the majority of H&amp;M and Zara’s fabrics are synthetics like polyester and acrylic, Uniqlo is full of natural fibers: merino and lambs wool, cashmere, and cotton.</p>
<p>A unique, yet unified uniform appears to be the formula at Uniqlo. A leisurely ride up the glowing escalator offers the first glimpse into the Uniqloset as mannequins dressed in various garments stand in the middle, separating the up and down escalators. The music is soft, the space is clean and open, comfortable, not like that time I walked into a Forever 21 to see what all the fuss was about and couldn’t find my way out for all the crowds, loud music, and mess everywhere. Uniqlo’s decor is modern, organized, and neat. The first floor is devoted to women’s clothing and any special collections, like the Uniqlo and Lemaire (former Hermès designer Christophe Lemaire) collaboration or the recent project with Liberty of London.  The second floor carries men’s and children’s and the third to additional outerwear, a café and lounging area.</p>
<p>I first visited a week after the grand opening, late afternoon on a Friday. The 60,000 square feet space did not overwhelm, it simply welcomed. My main area of interest lay at the first floor women’s department. The attention that Uniqlo gives to fabrics is immediately evident; softness surrounded me. From cashmere and merino wool to fleece, I couldn’t stop touching the garments.  What the clothes lacked in print or variety of style, they made up for in fiber. As I am fond of limits when shopping, at each visit I went with a goal in mind: from black sweater to navy trench coat to linen shirt for my brother. Without set boundaries in mind, fast-fashion retailers can be a drain on the wallet and psyche.</p>
<p>Uniqlo abounds with basics, from sweats to cardigans to turtlenecks. Basics are a necessary backbone to any wardrobe. They can be useful in layering, breaking up a busy palette, or creating a monochromatic one. At my initial visit I was in need of a basic black turtleneck to complete my Halloween costume: a beatnik/black panther/spy. So I chose several black turtlenecks, from the Lemaire collaboration, the Inès de la Fressange collection, and Uniqlo’s own, deciding upon the merino wool Lemaire turtleneck, for a mere $29.90. Clean and soft, it had the right amount of cling to the body, would serve me well beyond Halloween, and it has.</p>
<p>As Chicagoans, we are all in one way or another preparing for the winter, whether prepping our closets or getting in all the outdoor time we can before the cold hits, winter is always around the corner. With winter in mind during my first visit to Uniqlo, I took a look at the down coats. At $149, I wondered how warm could they be? The length was excellent, just what I was looking for, below the knee, but not a maxi coat. Then came the question of the down fill, how much goose down and feathers would be warming me in this coat? I am a label reader when it comes to food and clothing, a skill learned from the school of my mother, a skill and a person that I can always lean on.</p>
<p>The label was rather misleading, it read 53% down in the outer chamber, and then (minimum 80% down). Unfortunately the sale’s associate’s explanation did not clarify the matter. I learned that the coat was 53% down with the remaining 27% dispersed throughout the outer chamber of the coat, to achieve this minimum 80%. As the rest of the filling was polyester, I decided that it was simply not enough geese for me. Eccentric a demand or not, I was pleased that my request for label explanation was not met with a smirk, but with an attempt to clarify. Later in the winter, I ended up purchasing a knee-length Soia &amp; Kyo down coat, their labels are easy to read; 80% down, 20% feathers and as I already have a shorter down coat from them; I trust the durability and warmth of the brand.</p>
<p>Although Uniqlo’s products cater to a Midwestern sensibility for comfort, utility, and warmth, they cannot stand alone. One-stop shops may exist, but a one-stop style should not be the end result. It is often easier in our busy schedules to go to one shop and buy all that we need, but quality can be lost in this way. I have a particular grocer for my vegetables and another for my grains or meats. While it may be more time consuming to go to separate shops for these items, the quality and freshness is worth the time. I will likely make more visits to Uniqlo, but always with an intention, boutiques are made for lingering and appreciating, while large retailers are more in tune for necessity shopping. Mixing Uniqlo’s basics with more striking cuts of fabric or prints from smaller shops is key to differentiating one’s garment collection.</p>
