Touring Chic seeks out
fashion exhibitions in the Midwest. This first tour led me to exhibits
in Detroit, Toledo, Kent, and Indianapolis in December 2015. Some of the
exhibits like *Detroit D.Fined* and the Kent State University Fashion
Museum run through 2016. Others have passed, but Touring Chic reminds
that chic is everywhere, it just needs to be discerned by a chic
shifter.
