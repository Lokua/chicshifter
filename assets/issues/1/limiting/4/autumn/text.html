<p>  This week was tough; I actually had to visit my local Good Will to try out some fibers other than cotton! I ended up wearing cotton frequently; it is the fabric of our lives after all. I did find wool easy to wear and occasionally silk. Perhaps my clothing budget influence what fibers I purchase? Iâ€™m sure if I had a larger clothing budget I could buy more natural fibers. I was happy when this week was over and was overwhelmed with selfies. At first the selfies were fun then I got burnt out after four weeks of them!  </p>
