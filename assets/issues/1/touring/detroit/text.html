<p>Slowly rising from the ashes of its bankruptcy, Detroit is a city on the
move that knows how to honor the richness of its history and to promote
its future. From the Motown Museum and Diego Rivera murals at the
Detroit Institute of Arts to its hidden museum devote to its techno
music roots, I’ve always enjoyed uncovering yet another layer of culture
on visits to the motor city.</p>
<p>Museum exhibitions on fashion are fairly uncommon outside of New York,
but more and more cultural institutions are overlooking fashion’s
assumed frivolity in order to present it actively and sincerely through
various forms of exhibits. In December 2015, when I arrived at my first
stop, Detroit, for Touring Chic, the city was presenting the exhibit
<em>Fashion D.Fined: The Past, Present, and Future of Detroit Fashion</em> at
the Detroit Historical Museum, running through the spring.</p>
<p><em>Fashion D.Fined</em> was a fantastic exhibit, thoughtfully curated and
stunning for the eyes. The exhibit showcased fashion in Detroit in a few
ways. Firstly, there were sections devoted to several renowned designers
who hail from Detroit. Anna Sui, John Varvatos, and Tracy Reese.
Sprinkled throughout were contemporary local designers, including the
Detroit Denim Co., Ann Yee, and Bridget Sullivan. Finally, a brief look
into Detroit fashion and shops was organized by decade from the 1940s to
present-day.</p>
<p>The Detroiter along with me for these visits couldn’t tear herself away
from the Anna Sui garments on exhibit, and rightly so. Sui, who grew up
in Metro Detroit, carried that Midwestern spirit to New York for studies
and internationally later in her career. She created her own clothing
line in 1981, starting with five pieces and her first runway show in
1991 rocked her to the top.</p>
<p>The spirit of creativity, no frills, hard work, determination, and skill
fed her as it does contemporary Detroiters. We couldn’t stop oohing and
drooling over the Anna Sui dresses, picking favorites, imagining what
they felt like, what they would look like on our own bodies. All three
garments had high collars, and were extensively patterned, something
both of us adore, as evidenced by my friend Jin’s swan-printed leggings.
Sui’s patterns were floral, my favorite the shorter dress with the beige
lace bodice and vibrant skirt, whose pattern reminded me of the
needlepoint work in my aunt’s house. Jin’s favorite was the longer
dress, patterned in florals of rich blues and greens with loose sleeves,
in another floral motif, a Bohemian dress to go with the flow of her
roles as artist, and DJ.</p>
<p>Although it was fantastic to see garments by legendary designers like
Sui and Varvatos, the exhibit was formidable in its attention to the
current fashion scene and in paying homage to the past. I was surprised
to learn of the many fashion events that happen in Detroit, like the
WALK Fashion Show, which presents designers and models with a focus on
diversity, including models of various sizes and ethnic backgrounds,
taking place on May 22, 2016.</p>
<p>The two dresses on display from Detroit artist Bridget Sullivan were
ethereal, belonging to a modern day English garden party. Sturdy dresses
with floral embellishments, color, and distinct form, they fold up on
themselves, mimicking movement whilst standing still. Jin’s favorite
item in the whole exhibit was the mint green Sullivan dress with a mauve
underskirt and flowers. While not my favorite of the exhibit, I was
taken aback by her black dress with small orange flower decorations. The
flowers did not appear decorative at all, but entirely necessary, and
the bottom layer under the skirt helped to create the movement in the
dress. The dress was an example of ornament with a purpose. Adolf Loos,
who famously said: “the evolution of culture is synonymous with the
removal of ornamentation from objects in everyday use”, in his 1929
essay “Ornament and Crime”, may have even enjoyed this dress, though it
is by no means an everyday dress.</p>
<p><em>Fashion D.Fined</em> paid homage to designers, local shops, and the oft
forgotten fashion writer. At my first visit to Detroit’s Belle Isle
Park, I was drawn to an obelisk-like statue, protected by a small fence.
Tt appeared like a little castle, some dream world. There was a
miniature creek that encircled the tower and upon closer inspection, I
learned that it was erected in dedication of</p>
<p>Nancy Brown, a journalist known for her ‘Experience’ advice column for
the <em>Detroit News</em> around 1919. Detroit does not have the excessive
pride that other cities do, it is honest and dignified in its boasting.
<em>Fashion D. Fined</em> presents a few fashion writers who began their
careers at the <em>Detroit News</em>, Charlotte ‘Tavy’ Stone who began
freelancing there in the 1960s, Marji Kunz who also wrote for the
<em>Detroit Free Press</em> in the 1960s, and Cathy Horyn, at the <em>Detroit
News</em> in 1986, today the fashion critic for <em>New York Magazine’s</em> web
publication <em>The Cut</em>, and Robin Givhan at the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> in
the late 80s and early 90s, now fashion editor at <em>The</em> <em>Washington
Post</em>. As an admirer of Cathy Horyn’s decisive words, and an aspiring
fashion writer myself, I felt a surge of hope and inspiration while
reading this particular placard at the exhibit.</p>
<p>Define, display, decode, and dedicate; <em>Fashion D. Fined</em> does them all
in the span of two large rooms at the Booth-Wilkinson Gallery in the
Detroit Historical Museum. This exhibit, like so much that the city of
Detroit produces is carefully thought out, extensive, and
forward-thinking. “Fashions fade, style is eternal”, read a quote by
Yves Saint Laurent stenciled on to one of the exhibit walls. In a
similar spirit, I dare say, economies fade, but a city’s heart is
eternal.</p>
