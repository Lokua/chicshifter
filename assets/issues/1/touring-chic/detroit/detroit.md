Slowly rising from the ashes of its bankruptcy, Detroit is a city on the move that knows how to honor the richness of its history and to promote its future.  From the Motown Museum and Diego Rivera murals at the Detroit Institute of Arts to its hidden museum devote to its techno music roots, I’ve always enjoyed uncovering yet another layer of culture on visits to the motor city.

Museum exhibitions on fashion are fairly uncommon outside of New York, but more and more cultural institutions are overlooking fashion’s assumed frivolity in order to present it actively and sincerely through various forms of exhibits. In December 2015, when I arrived at my first stop, Detroit, for Touring Chic, the city was presenting the exhibit Fashion D.Fined: The Past, Present, and Future of Detroit Fashion at the Detroit Historical Museum, running through the spring.

Fashion D.Fined was a fantastic exhibit, thoughtfully curated and stunning for the eyes.  The exhibit showcased fashion in Detroit in a few ways. Firstly, there were sections devoted to several renowned designers who hail from Detroit. Anna Sui, John Varvatos, and Tracy Reese. Sprinkled throughout were contemporary local designers, including the Detroit Denim Co., Ann Yee, and Bridget Sullivan.  Finally, a brief look into Detroit fashion and shops was organized by decade from the 1940s to present-day.  

The Detroiter along with me for these visits couldn’t tear herself away from the Anna Sui garments on exhibit, and rightly so. Sui, who grew up in Metro Detroit, carried that Midwestern spirit to New York for studies and internationally later in her career. She created her own clothing line in 1981, starting with five pieces and her first runway show in 1991 rocked her to the top.

The spirit of creativity, no frills, hard work, determination, and skill fed her as it does  contemporary Detroiters. We couldn’t stop oohing and drooling over the Anna Sui dresses, picking favorites, imagining what they felt like, what they would look like on our own bodies. All three garments had high collars, and were extensively patterned, something both of us adore, as evidenced by my friend Jin’s swan-printed leggings.  Sui’s patterns were floral, my favorite the shorter dress with the beige lace bodice and vibrant skirt, whose pattern reminded me of the needlepoint work in my aunt’s house. Jin’s favorite was the longer dress, patterned in florals of rich blues and greens with loose sleeves, in another floral motif, a Bohemian dress to go with the flow of her roles as artist, and DJ.

Although it was fantastic to see garments by legendary designers like Sui and Varvatos, the exhibit was formidable in its attention to the current fashion scene and in paying homage to the past. I was surprised to learn of the many fashion events that happen in Detroit, like the WALK Fashion Show, which presents designers and models with a focus on diversity, including models of various sizes and ethnic backgrounds, taking place on May 22, 2016.

The two dresses on display from Detroit artist Bridget Sullivan were ethereal, belonging to a modern day English garden party. Sturdy dresses with floral embellishments, color, and distinct form, they fold up on themselves, mimicking movement whilst standing still. Jin’s favorite item in the whole exhibit was the mint green Sullivan dress with a mauve underskirt and flowers. While not my favorite of the exhibit, I was taken aback by her black dress with small orange flower decorations. The flowers did not appear decorative at all, but entirely necessary, and the bottom layer under the skirt helped to create the movement in the dress. The dress was an example of ornament with a purpose.  Adolf Loos, who famously said: “the evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornamentation from objects in everyday use”, in his 1929 essay “Ornament and Crime”, may have even enjoyed this dress, though it is by no means an everyday dress.  

Fashion D.Fined paid homage to designers, local shops, and the oft forgotten fashion writer. At my first visit to Detroit’s Belle Isle Park, I was drawn to an obelisk-like statue, protected by a small fence. Tt appeared like a little castle, some dream world. There was a miniature creek that encircled the tower and upon closer inspection, I learned that it was erected in dedication of
Nancy Brown, a journalist known for her ‘Experience’ advice column for the Detroit News around 1919. Detroit does not have the excessive pride that other cities do, it is honest and dignified in its boasting. Fashion D. Fined presents a few fashion writers who began their careers at the Detroit News, Charlotte ‘Tavy’ Stone who began freelancing there in the 1960s, Marji Kunz who also wrote for the Detroit Free Press in the 1960s, and Cathy Horyn, at the Detroit News in 1986, today the fashion critic for New York Magazine’s web publication The Cut, and Robin Givhan at the Detroit Free Press in the late 80s and early 90s, now fashion editor at The Washington Post. As an admirer of Cathy Horyn’s decisive words, and an aspiring fashion writer myself, I felt a surge of hope and inspiration while reading this particular placard at the exhibit.

Define, display, decode, and dedicate; Fashion D. Fined does them all in the span of two large rooms at the Booth-Wilkinson Gallery in the Detroit Historical Museum. This exhibit, like so much that the city of Detroit produces is carefully thought out, extensive, and forward-thinking. “Fashions fade, style is eternal”, read a quote by Yves Saint Laurent stenciled on to one of the exhibit walls. In a similar spirit, I dare say, economies fade, but a city’s heart is eternal.
