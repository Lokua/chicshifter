I thought this limit was going to be very difficult.  Once I began planning my outfits each day it got easier.  It was inspiring to see that I could pull off more looks than I thought. The further the week went by made me want to get more adventurous with my outfits.    Throughout this week I found myself wanting to go shopping to buy different style pants.  I realized at the end of this week that perhaps my relationship with clothes has become lazy and I should shop more open-mindedly.
