<p>  Color week was not a stretch for me, I love color! However, I usually only do color on top and denim on the bottom. This was a challenge because I only have blue jeans to wear, thank goodness denim counted as a color! It was fun seeing what others wore via Instagram and Facebook and gave me ideas to snazz up my color game. I loved color week, it was super.   </p>
