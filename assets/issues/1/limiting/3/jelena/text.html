<p>Ahhhh, color! Especially coming off of a week without it, I really appreciated being able to play. In contrast to last week, I found that I wear so many bold colors that accessorizing is less important, so I kept that as a theme. My mood got a boost and I found a bit more confidence in my walk. Even my customer meetings went a bit better. I wear jeans most of the week so it was nice to get back to my comfort zone. I find that I treat navy as a neutral color. The jeans and navy top with the red cardigan is indicative of my normal wear. Comfortable and cute is my goal for fashion, but now I'll add color to that list.  </p>
