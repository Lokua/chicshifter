Week 2 was easy breezy. I have a lot of neutral clothing. However, I do not have neutral accessories! I usually wear black with a pop of color in accessories but not this week. There are a few items I want to buy for myself after wearing mostly black and a day of beige/brown such as a white collared shirt and some black pants. Again, this limit made me want to go shopping.
