<p>Who doesn’t love a tall glass of milk? A lot of people don’t, including myself. But, a boutique called Milk that sells over 90% Chicago made goods, well that was surely something I could get a thirst for, and I did.</p>
<p>Hallie Borden, the owner of Milk Handmade in Andersonville, opened the boutique about four years ago, leaving behind a successful career in marketing to follow her dream of running her own boutique. She chose the boutique’s name as a play on her last name and the dairy provider.</p>
<p>Milk’s inventory consists of women’s clothing and jewelry sourced mainly from Chicago designers as well as independent designers from Minnesota and Canada. The sweater that took my heart and 80 bucks is from Quebecois designer Sheila Couture, part of her SHiliconfeETTI collection, inspired by Barcelona, from the Barcelona portion of this collection. Holland and Himalaya are two other Shiliconfetti collections, all made in Quebec.</p>
<p>I have long since sworn off buying neutrals or one color tops, vowing only to purchase prints full of colors. This however has been quite difficult as most of what I see is yet another solid neutral color to add to my already stuffed collection.  My Shiliconfetti sweater is not only fun to say, but the use of bright colors, three different prints on the sweater and varying colored stripes along the edges is a feat of great design, likely due to the designer’s background in graphic design. In addition, the thoughtful description on the tag describes the inspiration. It reads, “Pixels of lemons and ceramic flowers become a mosaic garden. Vitamins of Barcelona inspire flamenco passion and dance around to become the tapestry of a chic evening…” Who can overlook such care and beautiful imagery? Not me, of course. I wanted lemon and flower pixels to join together and dance around with me in my Chicago evenings. I easily and gladly parted with the sum because this was a sweater that I could tell I was going to live with happily ever after.</p>
<p>Renewed with hope that bold color and print did exist in Chicago shops for reasonable prices, I continued my exploration of Milk. There was no shortage of local talent, Midwest is Best tees by Megan Lee Designs, dresses by Wulfka, sportswear by Anna Hovet and scarves and blouses by another Chicago designer Sophia Reyes. Although none of these screamed out to me like the Shiliconfetti sweater, they showcased the variety of Chicago design and that was enjoyable to see. Milk is eclectic in its tastes and that’s what makes it distinctly Chicago, a mash-up of neighborhoods and people makes for an interesting array of attire.</p>
<p>A local designer, Lydia Crespo whose label, Argaman &amp; Defiance did stand out. I loved her raw silk crop top, loose fitting, hand-dyed top whose gold speckle on black made it look like a tiny galaxy. The last bit that I adored but didn’t purchase were winter gloves by French Knot, Massachusetts designed and handmade in Nepal. They were also in lovely prints and bright colors, combinations of blue and yellow, pink and orange floating around in my head. I may have to go back sooner than later.</p>
<p>Prints and colors aside, Milk has filled a fashion gap in Andersonville. While the stretch of Clark St. north and south of Foster boasts great bars, restaurants, and furniture shops, there isn’t too much going on in the garment section. Turley Road up the street from Milk is another well curated shop, although for a different type of wallet. The polyester heaven of Akira, well I’ve said enough about that. It’s simply not of the same caliber.</p>
<p>Although the amount that I spent on a sweater may seem like too much for some Chicagoans, I would like all of us to consider not just the amount we spend, but how and when we will wear the garment, and how it makes us feel. If something truly brings joy, then it will likely be worn often. I’m adhering to the motto of purchasing less but purchasing quality, and as silly as the name sounds, this Shiliconfetti sweater is well-made and makes my joy flutter all around and upside down.</p>
