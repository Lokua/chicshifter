<p>  Participating in this experiment was a lot of fun. I started at week three because I love colors! I think our streets are not colorful enough. The dominant colors in Chicago are classic black and white or shades of gray. I also like black, but every time I wear black I try to compose my outfit with contrast colors such as red, orange, purple, or pink. I have a large collection of colorful clothes that I didn’t have a chance to demonstrate in this week’s project, maybe in the future.</p> <p>My best friends are purple, orange, red, silver, and pink. I avoid wearing yellow and white, not because I don’t like them, but I just don’t look good in those colors. There is also no green in my color collection. Again, not because I don’t like the color green, it is just not my favorite color. I always try to wear colors that match and come together to create contrast. I absolutely love shoes and jackets. Cute outfits underlined by awesome shoes definitely get people’s attention. Prince no doubt had the best jackets; a nice jacket can make any outfit interesting. I enjoyed this fashion experiment so much. It led me to figure out how much I like stripes, something I hadn’t noticed before.</p>
