<p>This limit was fairly easy for me, which is likely due to the fact that I donâ€™t buy many synthetic fibers. But there was a concern one day as a sweater was not entirely made from merino and jeans often add polyester for stretch. I managed to be above the 70% limit every day except for the one where I was exactly at 70% natural fibers. </p>
