Apparently, it’s unadvisable to grocery shop while hungry, I learned that the hard way when I arrived home one Saturday morning with a whole rotisserie chicken, a jar of Nutella and a bunch of kale amongst a myriad other random food items. I no longer shop for food or anything else without a clear idea of my needs. Although clothing is not perishable like food, the same rules apply. Not to deny the treasures that can be found in browsing, but often it simply leads to unnecessary purchases, and clothes that are rarely worn.


(Instead of long intro, just a phrase)
Browsing in Chicago boutiques is often a great way to enjoy a bit of the outdoors while still being able to warm up when needed. Small business Saturday was a sunny but brisk day last November, and seemed like an appropriate day to go for a long walk and visit Union Handmade, an unusual boutique in that it is run by eleven members, from clothing and jewelry designers to milliners and knitters.

Union Handmade has been opened for two years now and provides a steady collection of founder Leigh DeLeonardo’s airy jackets, dresses, tunics, and coats alongside special-occasion dresses, handmade by Holly Greenhagen, another Chicago designer. There are about fifteen different designers represented at Union Handmade, mainly from the Midwest and some from Brooklyn. From chunky knits to loose-fitting tunics, the aesthetic ?????? comfort, quality of fabric, and singularity in design.


This was my second time at the boutique; the first time was in the spring, to peruse.  Now I had a mission: a chain necklace and circular pendant with an initial engraved for an old friend’s upcoming birthday.

The shop invites thoughtfully as all the senses are activated in the feel of the wools and other natural fibers, the sounds of light music, and the sight of the clearly organized tables and racks. Taste and smell were activated soon after entering when I was offered warm apple cider and cookies. My belly full and hands warmed up, I searched the jewelry table for the necklace. I found the “J” initial I was searching for but it was in brass and I needed the rosy colored pendant. Sure there were options I could’ve gotten, reading “bestie” or “babe”, I’m sure my friend would’ve enjoyed either but they simply didn’t satisfy my idea for the perfect birthday gift.

The beauty of a boutique like Union Handmade is that you can talk to the shop owner or designers directly. I mentioned to Leigh what I was looking for and she said that it was no problem for her to call Katie Mills aka Lady Faye Jewelry, the designer, and ask if she had any “J” pendants in her studio. Ten minutes later, everything was arranged, my copper pendant with necklace from Lady Faye Jewelry would arrive the following day. Experiences like this one help to create community, not only does it sustain a community economically but it also fosters solidarity. ---make it more conversational. (needs work)
