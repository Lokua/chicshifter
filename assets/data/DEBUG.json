My mother laughs and recalls that\nit was at this moment when she understood she couldn’t tell me what to\nwear, and has never tried to again. My initial refusal to wear dresses\nled to a later phase at the age of five of only wearing dresses with\npants, a trusted ensemble that I still revert back to as a\nthirty-something.</p>\n\n<p>Although I was never skilled with needle and thread for making clothes\nor pencil for sketching them, clothes and fashion have always been\nintegral to my understanding of self and others. However, despite my\nlove for fashion, mainstream fashion publications never fully engaged my\nfashion sensibilities. Until I found <em>WORN</em> <em>Fashion Journal</em>, a\nCanadian fashion magazine devoted to celebrating fashion for those that\nlove fashion but hate mainstream fashion magazines. Unfortunately, I\ndiscovered it too late, as it had already gone out of print in 2014.\nThus, I am creating <em>Chic Shifter</em> in this same rebellious spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, books such as <em>Women in Clothes</em> and <em>Fear and Clothing</em> have\nshown me that I am not alone in my desire for critical dialogue about\nfashion. Roland Barthes, Georg Simmel, Adolf Loos, Jean Baudrillard, and\n<em>Fashion Theory Journal</em> also raise important questions about fashion\ntheory and clothing that I will address within <em>Chic Shifter</em> with the\ndesire to foster further conversation.</p>\n\n<p>It is my hope that <em>Chic Shifter</em> will support a community of\nMidwesterners who are interested in learning about local designers,\nfashion exhibits, personal style and larger issues in the fashion world.\nAs a Chicagoan, I have always respected and loved the working-class\ncharacter of the city. Chicago is a tough city, the harsh weather can\nharden and invigorate. While the Chicago fashion sense tends to be\ndefined as utilitarian, sensible, and comfortable; there are often\ncareful details under the layers that play into a Midwestern aesthetic.</p>\n\n<p><em>Chic</em> Shifter is released biannually in keeping with a move towards the\nnotion of a slow fashion. This first issue for Spring/Summer, focused on\n“Four R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Renew, Risk” tackles issues of sustainability,\nconscious consumption, and the cyclical versus innovative nature of\nfashion. These four R’s are essential in considering Spring/Summer\nfashions as we shed layers of protection from the fall and winter and\nmove forward.</p>\n\n<p>A <em>chic shifter</em> works to shift fashion from just a consumer’s passing\nfolly to a thoughtful and concerned passion. Loving and supporting\nChicago fashion, and that of the Midwest, <em>Chic Shifter</em> carves out a\nspace for fashion criticism, and praise, all while dressed in whimsy and\nwit.</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h1>Finding Order Within Fashion’s Disorder</h1>\n<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>As much as the fashion industry presents itself in a state of constant flux, always innovating and offering different products, it can be liberating to think of fashion as existing within a system.  Roland Barthes, the French literary theorist, linguist and philosopher, introduced a linguistic order within fashion in his book,<em> The Fashion System</em>, written in 1967.</p>\n<p>Through Barthes’ semiotic analysis of clothing as written language, based on consulting issues of <em>Elle</em> and <em>Le Jardin des Modes</em> from June 1958–59, he argues that clothing shares with language the objective of communication. Barthes summarized his endeavor best in an interview with <em>France-Forum</em> in 1967:\r</p>\n<p>“My book is an itinerary, a patient, almost meticulous voyage\naccomplished by an ingenuous man who tries to see how meaning is\nconstructed, how men construct it—in this case, how fashionable clothing\nis made meaningful: thus, the book becomes a voyage of discovery, a\ntopical itinerary of meaning. And yet this itinerary is presented not as\na personal voyage but as a grammar, a description of levels of meaning,\nof units and their combinatory rules, in short, as a kind of syntax of\ndescription. The book will be justified if, being itself a composed\nobject, it manages to evoke before the reader’s eyes, in a kind of\nhomologous fashion, a new object which is clothing in the written mode.”</p>\n<p>While many of the chapters in <em>The Fashion System</em> address this application of structural linguistics to dress, I will focus on only one idea: that of rhythm within fashion. I found it most relevant to my current thoughts on fashion, the first “R” in this issue that is reduce. The notion of a rhythm in fashion is introduced by Barthes when he touches upon the work of American cultural anthropologist, A.L. Kroeber, father of famed writer, Ursula K. Le Guin.  Kroeber examined the principles that guided fashion from 1894–1919. The main premise of his work can be summed up by the following: “the rhythm of fashion change is not only regular (the amplitude is about a half century, complete oscillation takes a century) but tends to alternate forms according to a rational order; for example, the breadth of a skirt and that of the waistline are always in inverse relations: when one is narrow, the other is wide. In short, on a time scale of adequate duration, fashion is an orderly phenomenon, and this order comes from within fashion itself.”\r</p>\n<p>According to Barthes, if this rhythm continues to be regular, then skirt length will lengthen from 1967 on and at about 2020 or 2025, skirts should be long again. I found this information fascinating as I do see evidence to corroborate. The midi-length skirt has been a recent hit and maxi dresses continue to dominate much of the summer wardrobe offerings in 2016, so it seems reasonable to postulate that long skirts will be all the rage in four years. Fashion is too often thought of in the span of a few years, but if the range of perception is broadened to thirty or forty years, then seeing a historical continuity is possible. \r</p>\n<p>With each new season, designers are marketing the novel, the fresh and singular items that weren’t there the season before. It becomes even more complicated when today’s fashion introduces not two seasons a year, but eight or even 52 “micro-seasons.” How can fashions change so quickly? The careful observer will note that styles do not in fact change as fast as the industry would lead us to believe. \r</p>\n<p>One of the juiciest attractions to a television series like<em> Downton Abbey</em>, set between 1912–25, is not only the twisting plot lines and character development, but also the fashions of a century ago. Contemporary designers took a cue and the 2012 lines of Gucci, Ralph Lauren, and Anna Sui evoked the rollicking twenties. The bob haircut was one of the most popular cuts of 2015, another throwback to the previous century.  \r</p>\n<p>Examples of the cyclical nature of fashion are to be found everywhere. The disco ball has landed in all its metallic glory of fringe, jumpsuits, and high-waists; the ‘70s returned with a roar in 2014, after over forty years. The sixties influence can be evidenced in Miu Miu’s most recent collections—patent leather and patterns galore in bright baby-blues, sunshine yellows, and Kelly greens. The eighties influence is already being seen, in today’s oversized denim jackets, mirrored sunglasses, and the cuffed jeans.\r</p>\n<p>Fashion’s changes are not always easily reducible to a system as its language was for Barthes, but it is important to be aware of the regularity of trends so as not to fall prey to them each time they are marketed as “must have” or “season’s hottest.” There are plenty of fashion designers who are testing boundaries with their cutting-edge designs and truly offering a new idea. I’m reminded of Japanese designer, Kunihiko Morinaga’s brand Anrealage, who used photosensitive fabrics in his fall 2015 collection, which changed color when hit by spotlights on the runway, and Belgian fashion designer Iris van Herpen who has been working with 3D printing in her collections. On the other end of the spectrum, designers like local designer Leigh DeLeonardo offers quality-made classic garments that go beyond trend. \r<br>\nAlthough there are limits to Barthes’ linguistic model, as evidenced in Michael Carter’s 2012 article in <em>Fashion Theory Journal</em>, “Stuff and Nonsense: The Limits of the Linguistic Model of Clothing.” If we rely on this linguistic model we can ignore other discoveries. “Dress consists of material forms and is not just a notice board upon which are attached two-dimensional signs. Allowing for the profound conceptual transformations of clothing brought about by Barthes it is still not possible to wholly subsume clothing beneath the banner of communication,” writes Carter. </p>\n<p>Barthes’ writing on fashion appeals to me because of its organization of a seemingly chaotic aspect of the everyday into a manageable structure. For me, clothing is more approachable and manageable when I set limits or work within an imaginary system even. For example, if I only seek out patterns when shopping then the experience becomes less overwhelming than having no idea of what I want, which is a limit in itself. With no idea of what is wanted, surprises or extreme frustration can ensue. Following fashion’s trends is a fruitless and consuming labor. Establishing one’s personal style, however, is timeless and rewarding. Yves Saint Laurent’s famous phrase comes to mind, “Fashions fade, style is eternal.”\r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h1>Les collectionneurs /The collectors</h1>\n<h3>By Ana Nezna</h3>\n<p>Ever since reading <em>Women in Clothes</em>, a book that sets out to examine not what women wear but the reasoning behind their choices, I’ve been more attentive to my own clothing behaviors. The book is a collection of essays, conversations, photographs, and surveys from more than 600 women.  The authors, Sheila Heti, Heidi Julavits, and Leanne Shapton, sent out questionnaires to hundreds of women asking them a range of questions: “What is your cultural background and how has that influenced how you dress?” to “Are there any clothing (or related) items that you have in multiple?”  The women who contributed to the book include Cindy Sherman, Lena Dunham, Kim Gordon, Tavi Gevinson, and Miranda July. \r</p>\n<p>One section that I particularly enjoyed was “Collections,” a page of photographs devoted to documenting what various women collected, ranging from tote bags and nail polish to jean jackets and leopard-print tops.  The collections were never discussed in any detail, but the pictures were so lovely to look at, nine gray sweatshirts, ten pairs of marled socks, thirteen navy blazers, alike and different in their own ways. It got me thinking about my own collections, was there a clothing item that I had in multiple? \r</p>\n<p>I didn’t have to think long as I immediately remembered my own collection of striped shirts, mainly long-sleeved and a few short-sleeved, a collection I shared with one of the authors, Heidi Julavits. This led me to an endless list of questions: Why the striped shirts? When did I start collecting them? Why collect clothing? What do people in my social circle collect? Are collections treated differently from singular items? Do I care for my striped shirts more carefully than my one red dotted t-shirt?  \r</p>\n<p>Everyone collects; it’s a human activity. In Eric Rohmer’s film<em> La Collectionneuse</em>, Haydée collected lovers.  In a 2014 article from <em>The Guardian</em>, “Why do we collect things? Love, anxiety, or desire,” Christian Jarrett, psychologist and author of <em>The Rough Guide to Psychology</em>, says “One psychoanalytical explanation for collecting is that unloved children learn to seek comfort in accumulating belongings; another is that collecting is motivated by existential anxieties – the collection, an extension of our identity, lives on, even though we do not. More recently, evolutionary theorists suggested that a collection was a way for a man to attract potential mates by signaling his ability to accumulate resources.”\r</p>\n<p>Jean Baudrillard addressed collecting in his seminal text <em>The System of Objects</em>. He describes collecting as a type of organization in response to the ambiguity of our ordinary environment, “Collecting, however, offers a model here: through collecting, the passionate pursuit of possession finds fulfillment and the everyday prose of objects is transformed into poetry, with triumphant unconscious discourse.” He cites Maurice Rheims in likening collection to a “passionate game.” In thinking about my own collection of striped shirts, I could understand that I was not just seeking out any striped shirt, but that this collection had grown to be passionate in the sense that the shirts that made it into the collection were special and somehow heroic.   \r</p>\n<p>Inspired by <em>Women in Clothes</em>, I sent out a brief questionnaire to several friends, asking them what they collected, when they began collecting, why this particular item and if possible to provide a photo of their collections. Two friends responded.  \r</p>\n<p>Chris Roberts, a former artist formerly of Chicago who currently lives in Oakland, CA, is a collector.  I know him as a collector of sunglasses, and was sure he would report on that, but instead he responded with another of his trademark items: the golfer cap.  He’s been collecting them since 1997 and says, “Once I found my style, I just kept it.” Roberts, who says he’s often cold, needs the caps for warmth.  He doesn’t take any special care of them and says “usually once they start to smell they are used less in the rotation until they are phased out.”  The caps are of varying material, lighter cotton ones for the warmer months, and wool ones for colder weather, but always the same style.  The patterns vary as well, mainly plaid patterns although some are solid. Roberts will often take the time to modify the size if necessary by carefully stitching a fold in the back so that they fit him just right.  \r</p>\n<p>Dijana Savic, who lives and works in Paris, collects crochet pieces, a collection that she inherited from her mom and aunts.  Her grandmother crocheted the tops and dresses that were eventually passed down to Dijana and her sister.  This inherited collection led her to seek out more crocheted pieces, and she says, “there is something so elegant and enchanting about these handmade pieces and details.” When it comes to caring for these items, Dijana is very attentive. “There are certain pieces that are more resistant and durable and, therefore, I do wear them more often.  However, the crochet dress is a rarity—it's for particular occasions.” Even with the crochet tops, which she wears more regularly, Dijana likens wearing them to a “ceremonious occasion.”  This is, perhaps, due to the nostalgic effect that these pieces play, as her mother once wore them. \r</p>\n<p>This personal lineage remind me of another great section from <em>Women in Clothes</em>, “Mothers as Other.” In this section, women were asked to send photographs of their mothers from the time before they had children and describe what they saw.  Author, Sheila Heti said this of her mother’s photo, “That dress is great. I’m always looking for dresses like that. I move like my mother and have her body—especially her feet and hands. It troubled me when I noticed it as a girl, but now it makes me feel warm and closer to her.”  I have felt this many times looking at pictures of my own mother before she was a mother, and wishing she had saved this dress, those jeans, or that scarf.  Dijana’s collection also reminds us of the potential depth of clothing, when it is not viewed simply as a superficial form of mindless consumption</p>\n<p>And finally, back to my own collection of striped shirts in varying colors and sleeve-lengths.  I’ve been collecting them since 2008, and initially, they were only long-sleeved striped shirts due to Chicago weather, but recently I’ve acquired a few with short-sleeves.  A strict requirement for them is that they are made from 100% cotton. Colors and stripe thickness can vary.  \r</p>\n<p>I think I seek this item out because I’ve watched too many Godard films and have been influenced by the fashions in them.  But honestly, I enjoy prints in clothing, and stripes are an easy one to mix with other prints, like flowers.  I do take special care to preserve these items. One Sonia Rykiel striped top that was perhaps one of the first in this collection, I have patched the hole in the elbow so that I can continue to wear it. I try to rotate them so that the old ones can live longer while the younger ones get more usage.  \r</p>\n<p>But in the end, they are clothes and will fall apart and that is one thing that I value more than any collection—the ability to say goodbye to an item and move on.  My mother didn’t save the dresses and jeans that I drool over in photos from her youth.  She didn’t bother packing all her clothes or mine each time that we moved. Instead, she taught me how to value my clothes while at the same time understand what was no longer necessary. It’s these skills of selection and necessity that have helped me navigate through the sea of striped shirts and pick just one or ignore them all until the one I really want sails along or goes on sale, whichever comes first.  \r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h1>Case for Slow Fashion: Considering fibers</h1>\n<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>Reading labels on food items, personal toiletries, and pet food is something most 21st century individuals have grown accustomed to doing, whether we read them in order to know how many calories are in those pretzels or to know what our beloved pets are eating. While many are concerned with what they put into their bodies, few care about what covers the body in the form of clothing.\r\r</p>\n<p>I was taught to read clothing labels by my mother. She never gave me explicit reasoning, but I figured it out through all our time spent researching also known as shopping. She would gauge the fabric against the price and decide accordingly, so $5 was not too much to pay for a pair of 100% cotton socks but it was too much for 100% polyester socks. Cotton, wool, and linen always took precedence over polyester, viscose, rayon, and acrylic. \r</p>\n<p>As a teenager I had a hard time understanding the difference between acrylic and wool. So many sweaters I would pick up would be made from acrylic and it appeared just as soft as wool, but my mother was always wary, suggesting I wait until I find one made from merino wool. You never know until you try, and the same goes with fabrics. The acrylic sweaters I owned never lasted as long as the wool ones, and often pilled so I would spend half my dressing time removing the pilled fabric. \r</p>\n<p>After other unsuccessful attempts with synthetic fibers—the polyester dresses and blouses that were so sweet on the outside yet so stinky on the inside: making me sweat and feel like I was wearing a plastic rain poncho—I gave up on synthetics for the most part. I became a devotee to natural fibers, mainly cotton, as it was the most prevalent and affordable. My friend Emily, a fellow cotton lover, would joke each time she saw me, saying, “What are you wearing? Is it cotton?” And we would laugh as, nine times out of ten, it was indeed cotton. \r</p>\n<p>Reading Kate Fletcher’s book, <em>Sustainable Fashion and Textiles: Design Journeys</em> (2014), I was surprised to learn about the environmental toll waged by natural fibers. The large quantities of water used and pesticides applied to cotton are strongly correlated with negative environmental impacts, like according to Fletcher, reduced soil fertility, loss of biodiversity, water pollution and severe health problems. While irrigated cotton may require more water than polyester and other synthetics, these synthetics in turn require more energy. \r</p>\n<p>It seemed like a no-win situation, energy and water both being quickly depleted for the production of fibers. Such a large issue cannot be tackled in one fell swoop, so this is the first in a series of cases for Slow Fashion where I will outline various regions of the fashion industry, from production to consumption, in order to gain a better understanding in making personal choices regarding the purchase of garments.\r</p>\n<p>The first thing to consider in the chain is production, and by that I mean the fiber itself as that will affect and be affected by the rest of the cycle. For me, it seems like a logical starting point. According to Fletcher’s statistics, the two fibers dominating the market are cotton (25.10%), and polyester (36.46%). Overall, manufactured fibers, like polyester, nylon, and acrylic, and are on top. But there is no easy answer here. Although natural fibers are generally better for the environment, that does not mean they should be the only ones to cultivate. It is a mixture of the two, as synthetic and natural fibers have positive and negative sides. \r</p>\n<p>Fletcher proposes a diversification of material in order to achieve a level of harmony. “This strategy of materials diversity involves replacing some of the dominant or high-impact fibres with alternatives including low-chemical and organic cotton, hemp, lyocell, wool and PLA,” says Fletcher. Lyocell is a cellulosic fiber made from wood pulp. It was developed in the 1980s and is claimed to be environmentally responsible, although it is an energy-intensive fiber. Lyocell is becoming much more common and is a great summertime fabric. I have one sleeveless top from Lyocell and it is one of the lightest and breeziest summer tops in my wardrobe. Polylactic acid (PLA) is unlike conventional synthetics in that it is made from renewable sources, presently corn, and is compostable, unlike polyester, which is made from fossil fuels and non-biodegradable. PLA however like other biopolymers still retains negative effects of intensive agricultural methods required to produce corn.\r</p>\n<p>These alternatives generally yield a low energy and low water usage percentage as compared to conventionally grown cotton or synthetics like acrylic and viscose. Reading garment labels before purchase not only yields benefits to your skin, it also helps the environment. I have never believed it possible to change the world, only to change my actions, and what I can control, which is in itself a difficult task. </p>\n<p>While I am not keen on moralizing about fashion, I am interested in considering the material aspects that make up our world and our human relation to the physical world. How much of these problems are the production? How much are the consumption? Fletcher, in her other book <em>Fashion & Sustainability: Design for Change</em> (2011) presents a lovely map titled “Sustainabilica: A new continent of fibres”, where she outlines the various fibers we should be incorporating and how much space each should take, as if they were each their own country. Organic, low-chemical, low-water and rain-fed cotton takes up the largest space, with recycled and recyclable nylon, and polyester occupying a fair amount as well. While I have only touched upon the first chapter of Fletcher’s research from <em>Sustainable Fashion and Textiles</em> here, future cases for slowing down fashion will continue to appear in <em>Chic Shifter</em>. If we simply make a concerted effort to slow ourselves down by reading the label and considering the fabric, then that action will, in turn, dictate the supply. \r \r\r\n\n",

          "HTML": "<h1>Georg Simmel and the Passion for Fashion</h1>\n<h3>By Ana Nezna</h3>\n<p>Fashion is not a passion; it is, however, passing. One of the fundamental elements of its survival is its transitory nature, the speed at which it aims to trick and lure us unaware into its web of consumption. Things are changing though. More and more today, consumers are growing aware that their actions have consequences: on the planet, on other humans, and on themselves. \n</p>\n<p>The concept of Slow Fashion came into being thanks to the Slow Food movement, which began in Italy about twenty years ago. Slow Food began as a response to fast food, advocating a return to the joy of cooking and eating, to reconnecting people to one another, to their communities, and to the larger world. Slow Fashion began in much the same way, around twelve years ago as a response to the grave problems facing the garment industry. Factory disasters, like the Rana Plaza collapse in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2013 that killed a reported 1,129 workers, and the growing exploitation of natural resources have made some designers rethink their practices. Elizabeth L. Cline does a thorough job of describing many of these abuses as well as solutions in her book, <em>Overdressed</em> (2012).  I will address one of the solutions she suggests: the strength of the consumer’s choice.\n</p>\n<p>Over a century ago in 1901, Georg Simmel, the German sociologist, wrote an essay, titled “Fashion.” While the language denoting a primitive society needs to be adjusted for today’s intellectual context, the work still resonates in 2016 and can be linked to ideals set forth in the Slow Fashion movement. \n</p>\n<p><blockquote>“Fashion is the imitation of a given example\nand satisfies the demand for social adaptation; it leads the individual\nupon the road which all travel, it furnishes a general condition, which\nresolves the conduct of every individual into a mere example. At the\nsame time it satisfies in no less degree the need of differentiation,\nthe tendency towards dissimilarity, the desire for change and contrast,\non the one hand by a constant change of contents, which gives to the\nfashion of today an individual stamp as opposed to that of yesterday and\nof tomorrow, on the other hand because fashions differ for different\nclasses—the fashions of the upper stratum of society are never identical\nwith those of the lower; in fact, they are abandoned by the former as\nsoon as the latter prepares to appropriate them. Thus fashion represents\nnothing more than one of the many form of life by the aid of which we\nseek to combine in uniform spheres of activity the tendency towards\nsocial equalization with the desire for individual differentiation and\nchange.” </blockquote></p>\n<p>There is the crux of Simmel’s argument; fashion creates uniformity and individualization at once.  From there begins the challenge of the contemporary consumer of clothing as an aspect of fashion. The excerpt contains a hefty amount of information, all aspects of I may not be able to address, so let’s start slowly.\n</p>\n<p>Simmel’s idea is that fashion gives a particular crest to its age, to differentiate it from yesterday and tomorrow, kind of like the gold colored seals found on men’s navy-colored blazers. What happens in much of mainstream fashion is a perpetual yesterday, with some future occasionally tossed in. This endless search for trend is what is in fact destroying the fashionistae (the plural of fashionista), I propose. On this madcap route to trend, quality and endurance have been forgotten. \n</p>\n<p>The dignity of a garment lies not in its novelty but in its fortitude. The fast fashion giants—H&M, Zara, Forever 21, Uniqlo, The Gap—have a hold on buy three, get one free. Who needs four of the same t-shirt, shirt, or skirt? Apparently, all of us do. I have plenty of similar garments, primarily in the tops realm; they’re all cotton in either long or short sleeves. However, there are several that stand out, from memory: a brown-and-black striped cotton top from Sonia Rykiel the elbow of which I’ve patched once; a blue –and-white thin-striped cotton top with a by-now stretched out neck that adds a nice amount of allure; from the ‘label fell off because it’s so old’, and a pink, button-down shirt with little red mice chasing dispersed pieces of cheese all over it from Anthropologie. I’ve had these three tops for varying lengths of time, but all from seven to ten years old, and I think they will last another seven to ten years, primarily because I care for them and mend them. I can record all three from memory, not from digital memories, but of the ones that actually use the space in my brain, so they are special to me.  \n</p>\n<p>The second idea of Simmel’s that I’d like to address is the one about class differences in fashion—how the upper echelon differentiates from the the lower class, and in addition that fashions are abandoned by the upper strata if they become appropriated by the lower. It is, at first glance, quite easily true and a myriad of examples can be given to prove the point. However I find it much more stimulating to think of the appropriation of the lower class’ fashion by the upper class. Styles come from the street and they always have. \n</p>\n<p>Walking on the street creates fashion. Why is sportswear so popular now? No surprise, regular folks have been wearing sportswear stylishly for decades. Binaries of class aren’t necessary. The simple acknowledgement that the upper and lower strata tale, borrow, and, sometimes, steal from one another is cyclical. It is interesting to note that designers like Vetements are profiting on the working-class culture, offering DHL t-shirts for $330. (Henry Ford increased the worker’s salary so that they could afford to buy a Ford automobile. I wonder if the same is true of Vetements garment makers?) I am simply remarking upon mediocrity of the design. The word vêtements in French means clothes. It is a cheeky name for a clothing label, but does it have more than cheek? Is there a functioning brain atop the cheeks, I wonder?\n</p>\n<p>Fashion, according to Simmel is fickle in the sense that while it promotes an attachment to a larger group, it also encourages individual differentiation. Even in striving to be an individual though we echo the sentiment to those that desire to be alike. This is fascinating to think about, because I know that it is relevant of some of my clothing choices. I also strongly desire to belong and be separate. \n</p>\n<p>Four to five winters ago, I would regularly pass a woman on my morning commute with a rich, wine-colored fall/early winter coat, covered in a large hood. I loved seeing not only the woman, but also her coat. A winter or so later, I found a wine colored hooded wool coat, different from hers in its details, length and fit, but nonetheless, inspired by this woman who I would see walking. In my desire to differentiate myself, I had become a part of this woman. \n</p>\n<p>More recently, the same has happened with a fall/spring navy trench coat. My initial inspiration for the absolute need for such a coat lay in the British detective mini-series, <em>River</em>, with the actor Stellan Skarsgård, whom I know from Lars Von Trier films. In this series, Skarsgård wears the perfect detective coat; it’s knee-length, waterproof, and black. Mine, however, is navy, and I wear it all the time since the weather has been significantly above freezing. Recently, I remembered another passerby who inspired this coat. Like the woman who inspired the red coat, this man has worn his navy coat in every passing memory I have of him, and I realize that in some little ways, fashion allows me to emulate people that intrigue me. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe each have our stories with the world that surrounds us, from our furniture to our pets and loved ones. Clothing is a part of that belonging and opposing, which makes it important to consider. Regardless of economic niveau, the thoughtful choice is part of everyone’s daily routine. \n</p>\n",

The dominant colors in Chicago are classic black and white or shades of gray. I also like black, but every time I wear black I try to compose my outfit with contrast colors such as red, orange, purple, or pink. I have a large collection of colorful clothes that I didn’t have a chance to demonstrate in this week’s project, maybe in the future.</p> <p>My best friends are purple, orange, red, silver, and pink. I avoid wearing yellow and white, not because I don’t like them, but I just don’t look good in those colors. There is also no green in my color collection. Again, not because I don’t like the color green, it is just not my favorite color. I always try to wear colors that match and come together to create contrast. I absolutely love shoes and jackets. Cute outfits underlined by awesome shoes definitely get people’s attention. Prince no doubt had the best jackets; a nice jacket can make any outfit interesting. I enjoyed this fashion experiment so much. It led me to figure out how much I like stripes, something I hadn’t noticed before.</p>   "

They are mostly not breathable, and make you sweaty and itchy. I always try to buy clothes made from natural fibers. I like silk, and linen because they are breathable, soft and comfy. They are great in the summer. I can’t imagine life without cotton. It is great in the summer and great in the winter. I love wool for its warmth. As accessories, I like the best silver jewelry. In my collection there are pink pearls, wood and fiber jewelry and a bunch of different types of minerals framed in silver. I enjoyed this week a lot, and I started thinking more about fibers and materials in my wardrobe. </p>  "

I like wearing this belt my sister bought me with this outfit.  The last day I chose a black fitted turtleneck and a black skirt with high top sneakers.

Even my customer meetings went a bit better. I wear jeans most of the week so it was nice to get back to my comfort zone. I find that I treat navy as a neutral color. The jeans and navy top with the red cardigan is indicative of my normal wear. Comfortable and cute is my goal for fashion, but now I'll add color to that list.  </p>"

          "HTML": "<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>Where do young fashion designers in Chicago go after they’ve received their degrees? Many leave the city for brighter prospects on one of the coasts or in Europe. Those that choose to stay and are lucky enough, go to Macy’s. To the eleventh floor that is, where the Chicago Fashion Incubator (CFI), a two-year fashion residency program for emerging designers, resides. \r\r</p>\n<p>Although this may come as a surprise to some, Chicago has a history of garment manufacturing, which flourished primarily during and slightly after World War II. The city is still home to high-quality men’s suit makers: Hart Schaffner Marx and Oxxford Clothes. That history was somehow forgotten, until former Mayor Daley began the city’s fashion initiative in 2005. CFI and Fashion Focus Chicago were two of the products of this endeavor.  While Fashion Focus, a week of fashion shows and talks about the fashion industry has been sadly defunct since 2015, the CFI still appears to be going strong. \r</p>\n<p>“When Mayor Daley started the incubator back in 2007, he had hoped to bring up more manufacturing, make it alive again, make it a center, providing more jobs for people and making it a potential place for designers to stay longer here or to really create their businesses,” says Andrea Reynders, Design Director of CFI. Reynders who is also Professor Emeritus at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she earned her BFA, began working on the board of the Chicago Fashion Incubator when former student, Lara Miller, then executive director of CFI, asked her to join in 2010. When Miller left to focus on her own clothing line, Reynders took over as Design Director and mentor in 2014. The board also hired Trideep Das, a brand strategist, as business director at that time. \r</p>\n<p>The incubator provides six fledgling designers with the resources to bridge the gap from fashion students to fashion entrepreneurs. CFI supports the designers by offering them a workspace, shared offices, and a curriculum of business and creative workshops, and mentoring. “Coming from a strong art and design background, there was virtually no business knowledge, so understanding my consumer, how to do a competitor’s grid, understanding the ins and outs of that, I’m learning all that,” says Shruti Kirti, who is now in her second year at the incubator.  Like Kirti, Anna Brown, another CFI second-year designer, agrees that the incubator has helped her to professionalize her practice while offering crucial creative and business support. \r</p>\n<p>The designers have varied focuses: four in womenswear, one in menswear, and one in swimwear. Each develops two collections during their time at the incubator. Kirti, who was a student of Reynder’s at SAIC, began the program in March 2015, and was working on her fall/winter 2016 collection when I first met with her in November. Her clothing line concentrates on career wear with functionality. “Your clothes really have to carry you through the day, so I’m working with a specific fabric that’s referred to as scuba,” says Kirti. “It doesn’t wrinkle or stretch easily, but is comfortable and soft, and it adds a little funkiness to career wear.”\r</p>\n<p>Their collections are as varied as their goals at CFI. Whereas Kirti is focused on selling her collection direct to consumer, Brown is moving towards selling her collection to boutiques. “Coming here, my goal was to move into selling wholesale to boutiques as I was having trouble reaching my customer. I wasn’t able to market myself properly, so I thought to give the wholesale route a shot,” says Brown. \r</p>\n<p>Brown makes clothing for someone who is looking for more creativity in her wardrobe. “I try to make a more nuanced modern collection. I’m sort of a minimalist and I guess a little bit of a modernist in terms of my approach to design, as I try only to include what is essential in terms of structure to the garment,” she says. Brown is interested in creating contemporary staples for a women’s wardrobe, clothes that retain an ease of use, but that also define the body, and have structural interest and functional yet refreshing details like pockets.\r</p>\n<p>Midwestern cities like Chicago often have a hard time keeping their designers, not due to the lack of creative energy but to the lack of manufacturing. “The lack of manufacturing here is a problem for all of us; it makes it difficult,” says Brown. Recalling the early strength of the Apparel Industry Board of Illinois (AIBI) in the 1970s, Reynders says: “That organization was very powerful at some point, and they even built what was the garment center, right next door to the Merchandise Mart. Their dream was to bring buyers to Chicago, and it worked for a couple of years, because people were curious and interested. The point was to build up Chicago, but it was a big struggle, and I believe primarily due to the manufacturing; couldn’t start the fire under it, it would always smolder out.” \r</p>\n<p>Today, with organizations like CFI, Chicago is working not only to educate but also to retain its local designers, like Kirti, who says, “I want to grow this business here and use local resources. Midwestern is a compliment to me, that’s what I want it to be.” So far, Kirti has been successful. Her fabric is sourced locally, and she has been able to locate a seamstress and photographer in Chicago with the help of the incubator resources. \r</p>\n<p>Being outside of a centralized fashion capital has advantages for emerging designers. “The Chicago market isn’t over-saturated and we get to experiment and explore who we are as designers,” says Kirti. CFI supports its designers in various ways, with one-on-one mentoring, trunk shows, and practical business advice. “I tend to think of the Midwest as meat and potatoes, it’s serious about its work, we’re not flamboyant,” says Reynders. The incubator designers are always at work, whether cutting fabric for their patterns, organizing photo shoots, or traveling to boutiques to show their current collections. “I’ve taken everything up a level here, and I wouldn’t be able to do this on my own,” says Brown of her time at CFI. \r</p>\n<p>The life of a CFI fashion designer isn’t only about dress forms, fabric, and designs; a lot of footwork is involved. “Many of the designers get on the road; either they pack and fly to a city, make appointments with boutique owners, show their collections, and sometimes there’s a trunk show involved,” explains Reynders.  When I met with Anna Brown in February, she had just returned from a short trip to New York, scouting boutiques that may be potential buyers for her collection, and was busy starting on her spring/summer 2017 collection. \r</p>\n<p> “I really think there’s something amazing that’s going to happen in fashion,” says Reynders. “There’s going to be a huge change and I feel it already. There are many small, independent designers in New York, California, Chicago, St. Louis who are making a really good product, trying to make it locally, or at least nationally.” \r</p>\n<p>Bridget Foley’s article “Fashion’s Existential Crisis” published October 2015, in <em>Women’s Wear Daily</em>, echoes Reynder’s sentiment. “It feels as if fashion is on one giant collision course with itself and everyone’s talking about it, designers included. While no one wants to turn back the clock (not possible, and reactionary doesn’t fly in fashion), many wonder—out loud—how to evolve (or perhaps revolutionize) the system in a way that makes sense.” \r</p>\n<p>The responsibility for conscious fashion is not solely left to the designer but, perhaps, and even more so, to the consumer. Shruti Kirti laughs as she relates that she herself does not shop much, and advises the fast-fashion, trend-hungry consumer, to simply “shop less!” This may be the key formula to creating a healthier relationship to fashion: shop less and analyze more in order to develop personal style, while hopefully supporting our local clothes makers. \r</p>",

          "HTML": "<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>“I am not a fashion designer, I am a clothing designer and I see a huge distinction in that,” says Leigh DeLeonardo, answering my initial question about her work as a fashion designer. I had been using the two words fairly interchangeably, and I was intrigued by her response as it forced me to consider my usage which had become automatic, and in many ways, empty of meaning. According to DeLeonardo, fashion is transitory, always chasing a trend, forever searching for the new, and is a heavily loaded word. She prefers to create clothing that is timeless, that builds an environment for the wearer, leaving her the freedom to go about the important aspects of their day, while supporting her in these endeavors. \r</p>\n<p>\rClarity and rigor are evident not only in DeLeonardo’s discussion of her design, but also in the execution of her creative process. “I’m a firm believer in having a supportive process. I learned that looking at a gigantic task like getting a collection on the racks is extremely stressful. So I break it down into its stages and its steps, and I let that guide me through to the end,”she says. First, she researches at the Newberry library, leafing through old copies of <em>Vogue</em> or <em>Gazette du Bon Ton</em>; then she sketches, sometimes up to 300 sketches a collection; from there she iterates until she arrives at a garment that is born of her efforts, editing down to around 20 favorite garments. \r</p>\n<p>DeLeonardo creates several collections throughout the year including seasonal transitions, loungewear, separates, and a linen line, with an average of about nine pieces per collection. Since she is in the position of being both a storeowner at Union Handmade, a boutique representing about fifteen different designers, and a clothing designer, DeLeonardo has to wear multiple hats and provide the variety of garments needed for the store. With the help of Jamie LaPorta, her partner at Union and knitwear designer, DeLeonardo develops these mini collections to fill any gaps that may exist in the store’s offerings.  \r</p>\n<p>She has used the same woven labels bearing her name since the beginnings of her career, from about 1986. In addition to marking her clothes, the Leigh DeLeonardo label acts as an editor for the designer. “This label tells me what I can do in a way, like if I wanted to make a big fun pair of overalls, I couldn’t do it with that label, it just wouldn’t make sense,” she says. The Camp shirt is one example of the classic and sophisticated aesthetic of the Leigh DeLeonardo label. \r</p>\n<p>DeLeonardo found a way around her internal editor and created a new label, Union brand, that allows her to create more relaxed, youthful, and simple pieces at a lower price point. Along with LaPorta, she developed the Union brand, both to fill a need in the shop, and to challenge herself as a designer. \r</p>\n<p>The Union garments are playful and less refined. A Union bowling shirt, in linen, one of the designer’s favorite fabrics, is full of surprises, offering a small sailor collar and pockets. Pockets are not unique to the Union brand; they are part of much of what the designer creates, believing in the utility as well as quality of an item of clothing. While the majority of DeLeonardo’s garments come in solid colors or yarn dyes, Union offers a dress and skirt in a gray and black plaid with hints of red. Pattern is not limited to the Union label; the spring/summer collection, for example, includes floral print fabrics. Much of the difference between the two labels lies in the detail, and finishing of the garments. Anything made for the Leigh DeLeonardo label takes more time than with Union, according to the designer. \r</p>\n<p>Asking a clothing designer if they choose fabric or decide the shape of the garment first is like the chicken and egg question, one cannot exist without the other, but each designer inevitably has their own method. “My work is about the cut, shape and detail so I need to find fabric that supports these elements.  More recently I've been occasionally starting with the fabric and letting it tell me what to do with it.  I think this is a great way to develop an idea but also it's a bit of a necessity because of how hard it has become to find great fabric.  Sometimes you have to use what you find rather than finding what you need,” she says.  The limiting fabric choices are something that all small-scale designers struggle with and the one thing that DeLeonardo misses from her days of wholesaling to stores like Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue.  But the greater creative freedom and closer relationship with the customer far outweigh any negatives of working independently. \r</p>\n<p>The day we met, DeLeonardo’s dark, shoulder-length hair lay in two braids, and her thick bangs were welcoming and youthful. She wore a linen top of her own design, black trousers and funky yet comfortable Trippen shoes. Like her shoes, DeLeonardo’s designs exude a feeling of coziness, but not in a lazy way. She is concerned about the quality, the fit, the fabric, her customer; and every little detail is contemplated by this American designer. “I come from the place of being a problem solver,and  my designing is very much inspired by the problems that I’m trying to solve,” says DeLeonardo. Including American designers in our closets is something worthy of attention and action. \r</p>\n<p>While my closet is sadly devoid of any garments bearing the Made in USA label, save for a couple American Apparel garments, DeLeonardo reminds me of the gravity of this situation while discussing the Limiting section of Chic Shifter. She suggests a limit of wearing only American-made garments, which I quickly realize would be next to impossible for the majority of Americans. My clothing consumption has been slowly shifting with age and awareness; I choose to buy less on trend and spend more on quality and growth. Both the Union and Leigh DeLeonardo garments seem to me like they could take me through various stages of my future. \r</p>",

          "HTML": "<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>Fashion, like dance, belongs to the body. Both are separated from the visual arts. In a 2007 article from <em>Fashion Theory </em>“Fashion as Art; Is Fashion Art?” Sanda Miller posits that, “[W]e even have a category of activities positioned at the interstices of the visual arts, including dance, circus clowns and culture, kitsch, nature, rain, personal beauty, etc., which, like fashion, were not traditionally considered to be art and thus subjects for aesthetics.” While dance has always been considered one of the seven fine arts, this debate continues today with regard to fashion. But designers like Katrin Schnabl, eschews this argument; she is a dancer, fashion designer, artist, and educator. \r</p>\n<p>Beginning as a dancer in her native Frankfurt, Germany, Schnabl made her own costumes. “I thought every dancer made their own costumes, and it was not until I came to New York that it became quite clear to me that no, not every dancer has the same kind of energy about addressing what needs to be on them in order to perform, and what I needed to do to perform,” she told me. Her relationship with the body comes first from dance, from considering how it navigates and engages with space to how it activates that same space. She considers dance the first art. “It doesn’t need language,” she says. “It is very direct; it’s in time and in sync with the body, and it happens here and now.”\r</p>\n<p>Through her work with dance companies and avant-garde theaters in both Frankfurt and the downtown dance scene of New York, she gained much experience that continues to influence her design philosophy today. She worked with a variety of body types, both male and female, and most importantly, learned what elements can be added to a dance, without being distracting, to help the dance read clearer. This particular idea translates into her approach to fashion design. She is interested in taking away from a garment, in allowing the garment to be worn, not to be the one doing the wearing. “To me it’s a lot about what can you take away before it collapses, like the Mikado game of pick-up sticks. The dancer or wearer does so much, I don’t want to compete with or overpower the wearer,” she says. \r</p>\n<p>Speaking about her transition to fashion design, Schnabl recalls: “in an interesting way you generate a lot of ideas and you vet them against choreographic limitations, entrances and exits, from the bodies themselves. You start with a lot and you narrow it down to relatively little. So you have all of this leftover material, it may not have been right for a particular dance, but in and by themselves they were pretty cool, so I would start wearing them.” After taking a self-imposed sabbatical from dancing, Schnabl enrolled in a draping class at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which she enjoyed so much that she ended up continuing on to receive her BFA in 1995.</p>\n<p>Schnabl doesn’t speak about her design work in traditional seasonal collections, from autumn/winter or spring/summer, but in more abstract notions, choosing to address the ideas behind the garments, like the importance of fabric. One of her ideas about fabric reminded me of my beginner level sewing class at Vogue Fabrics several summers ago and I wished that someone had told me that when I was choosing a fabric for my pencil skirt. “I’m always saying the hand picks the fabric, keep the eye off of it, because the eye isn’t a good fabric picker, so the hand has to pick. The eye gets to do a lot of other things,” she explains.  I, however, picked the fabric with my eye and ended up with an unstable pencil skirt.  Schnabl, however, knows her fabrics, “I think it’s a nice luxury that I’ve evolved towards, I don’t want to work with fabrics that don’t feel good. At the end of the day it ends up on the body, and it has to go through my hand, cutting it and sewing it. Why have a fabric that is not satisfying in the process of making?”\r</p>\n<p>Schnabl is attracted to the element of surprise in her work. Fashion is a field that she knows so well but continues to offer nuances of discovery, much like her garments did for me when I saw them in motion. On the day we met, she was wearing garments of her own making—from the soft white jeans, a sleeveless gray top, and a surprising tunic that turned into a shop coat. When she stood up to show me how the tunic functioned, her dancing days were immediately visible. She is a tall, svelte woman whose poised movements are those of a dancer. About the tunic, Schnabl says that she couldn’t make up her mind while draping, so she made it do multiple things. It can be worn the way she initially had it on, more like a vest or tied like a shop coat, or reversed and worn to the front like a dress. \r</p>\n<p>\rTiny hints of color are another important consideration in Schnabl’s design aesthetic. “When it comes to color, it’s the first thing you see, it really drives the emotion,” she says. “You pick up the color before you see the shape, definitely before you see the detail and before you get close.” Her use of color has grown to be a brand signifier; people love that little bit of articulation, the attention paid to the garment inside and out. Sometimes the color is subtle, as with her gray tunic, where a strip of orange flashes out from the inside or as another layer to her gray top. This direct use of vivid color is evident in her spring/summer 2016 collection, where hues of orange and blue pop. \r</p>\n<p>Currently, Schnabl is in the process of reexamining and shifting her artistic practice, as she considers moving away from the restrictions of creating two collections a year. Her current atelier in Old Town is being phased out. This studio space is where she and Birgit Rohm, CEO and Co-Founder, have hosted numerous events for the fashion community. Although these events were integral to the company and the broader Chicago fashion public, Schnabl is interested in refocusing on design and artistic collaborations now. She admits the challenges faced by fashion designers in a non-fashion center like Chicago, from the loss of manufacturing to a lack of resources and relevance, are sometimes daunting. Neither of the two major newspapers pays fashion any mind.\r</p>\n<p>She is using this time not only to shift potential modes of production, but also to reflect. “I want to explore how fashion can engage differently within a place. I’m very passionate about my work and I’m interested in what would truly be alternative modes of creating relationships through fashion,” she says. Ultimately, better problems and questions are what Schnabl is looking for, how to invest in the fashion moment, the Chicago moment, to design the constellation within which the garment can exist and have a complexity.\rAs for getting to these moments, problems, questions, and constellations through her design process, Schnabl quotes the French proverb, “l’appétit vient en mangeant” (appetite comes with eating). By designing, creativity grows and the practice evolves and progresses, so she keeps some things unfinished, allowing the ideas to be harnessed for a future collection. “There’s nothing I’d rather do in my life than go to my studio and come up with an expression for a moment.” \r</p>\n",

Many fashion designers choose to work this way, including such big-timers as Tom Ford and Burberry, who have recently decided to shift to this type of scheduling. Prêt à porter will soon become not only ready-to-wear, but also ready-to-buy.  The clothes appear on the runway, and are available immediately, leaving no time for fast-fashion retailers, like Zara and H&M, to copy designs and make cheap knock-offs for the upcoming season.  Reynders, who has been working this way for the majority of her collections, says that it works perfectly on a smaller scale. </p>\n\n<p>\r\rIn addition to working in real time, her approach to fashion design is real and down-to-earth. She chooses distinct fabrics that cohabit the space of the body with their innovative design. Her fall/winter 2015 repurposed collection was chock full of gorgeous and hearty wools, cashmeres, and felt. At her trunk show in November at Robin Richman boutique in Chicago’s Bucktown neighborhood, Reynders' love of winter was evident. “I think that’s my favorite season because I love the volume, the thickness, and the heaviness of wool. Growing up in this part of the country, we need that kind of clothing, so I understand it, I appreciate it, and I like to work with it,” says Reynders. For this repurposed collection, Reynders scouts thrift stores and consignment shops to find cashmere sweaters, well-constructed jackets, which she then takes apart, cuts up, and puts together in order to create garments like the beige wool sweater that I fell in love with. The sleeves and pockets of sturdy boiled wool give the sweater a structure and volume that permeates all of Reynders' designs. </p>\n\n<p>\r\rReynders, who is also the Design Director at the Chicago Fashion Incubator, and Professor Emeritus at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), bakes a fantastic pear pie. Arriving late to her home and studio in Woodstock, IL, I was greeted by her English Labrador, Becca, and Reynders, who was wearing a loose black dress with an empire waist over black trousers. After some pear pie, tea, and several petting sessions with Becca, we went downstairs to her studio to look at some garments from the fall/winter collection, as well as sketches and fabrics for the current spring/summer collection. Reynders, who wears round, tortoise-shell glasses, the kind that recall French actresses of the sixties, explained to me how important the lighting was in her new studio space. Since it lacks natural lighting, Reynders' husband located LED lights that simulate natural light, which make all the difference for garment design and construction. Her studio space is as simple and neat as the rest of her home, with two large cutting tables take up the majority of the space, a sewing machine, dress forms, and a couple hanging racks standing off to the sides. Reynders, whose home is a renovated one-room schoolhouse, like her garments is repurposed and contemporary at the same time, classic and modern like the fabrics she chooses.\r\r</p>\n\n<p>For her current collection, Reynders is working with lightweight fabrics like silk and nylon taffeta in navy, pewter gray, black, and she’s on the hunt for a few more colors. “I’m looking for a pure white, and a blush color, maybe an olive green. I’m looking personally for red, a really true red, and even if I don’t sell it, I’ll make something for myself,” says Reynders. For the fabrics, she will have to fly to New York for the weekend, as most local designers are limited by the scope of the Chicago market. In addition to the concern for the garment colors, many small designers, including Reynders are limited because they must buy in small quantities. Although all of these considerations can be difficult Reynders’ approach to design makes these limits of the market insignificant. She works within her means. </p>\n\n<p>\r\rTake the female body, which changes shape so much through a woman’s life, up and down and all round or square, sometimes triangular or pentagonal. “I like to design in a way in which my clothes fit easily on people, that these clothes are comfortable enough that they can wear them always,” says Reynders. For example, she makes a skirt with a semi-wrap. “Part of it is sewn, but around the waist, it opens up all the way. It offers you an opportunity to move over those buttons if you need it tighter or looser. And people have loved that, that little bit of personalizing in the fit,” she explains. Many of the jackets from her fall collection have longer sleeves that can be cuffed up or left long to bundle the hands down in the harsh midwestern winter Reynders is so familiar with and fond of. \r\r</p>\n\n<p>In addition to creating clothes that grow with a person, Reynders subscribes to the slow movement in fashion that is gradually coming to the forefront. “I like to make clothes that I know people are going to put in their wardrobe and be happy with for years to come, that there is an endurance quality to them,” she says. This lack of trend chasing is indicative of her clients as well, who can be described as women who are more defined in what they want, who are willing to spend more on a coat that they know they will always have and want to wear. Reynders’ “Anya-Flip” coat is a prime example of the various elements behind her design philosophy. </p>\n\n\r\r<p>The coat can be worn in two ways, as a shorter coat with two front pockets and a full collar that can be worn as a hood, to protect from a drizzle, or when turned inside out and upside down, it becomes a longer coat, still with the two usable pockets. The version that I saw was in a rich black made from a high-tech fiber, a well-made synthetic that is easily folded up. One of her best-selling garments, the coat can be made in various colors, and she has also made versions in wool. Whether working in natural fibers or modern synthetics, Reynders’ ability to understand and manipulate shape on the human form is astonishing as she creates a romance with color, texture, and volume.\r\r </p>\n\n<p>“Sometimes my process is about a solution to an event or something new to replace another article—but it is always about listening to the person and finding out what they want and making it even better. Today fashion is not about style dictation of a certain kind—rather enabling a discovery, a romance to happen between a garment and its wearer,” says Reynders of her approach to design. The trust that Reynders has built with her clients and within herself is evident in her expansive career, from her work as a designer to teaching at SAIC.\r\r\r</p>\n\n<p>I’m slowly growing an affinity for synthetic fibers after viewing some of Reynders’ collection. I was especially taken with and bewildered by a synthetic black taffeta from her upcoming spring collection that makes the most exquisite sound of rustling paper or leaves. It has movement and a crushable quality that allows for a large collar, worn up or down or in a variety of other choices, depending on her design. “I really believe in the slow movement in fashion, like from farm to table, from sewing machine to your body; it’s really important,” she says. Reynders’ home is a renovated one-room schoolhouse, like her garments it is repurposed and contemporary at the same time, classic and modern like the fabrics she chooses. Reynders thinks about the woman she designs for, not as a frivolous fashionista, but as a conscious and reasonable woman whose strength is only heightened by the garments she wears. \r\r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">\n  5137 N Clark<br>\n  Andersonville, Chicago\n</h5>\n\n<p>Who doesn’t love a tall glass of milk? A lot of people don’t, including me. But, a boutique called Milk Handmade that sells over 90% Chicago-made goods, well that was surely something I could get a thirst for, and I did. \r</p>\n<p>Hallie Borden, owner of Milk Handmade in Andersonville, opened the store about four years ago, leaving behind a successful career in marketing to follow her dream of running her own boutique. She chose the shop’s name as a play on her last name and the dairy provider. \r</p>\n\n<p>Milk’s inventory consists of women’s clothing and jewelry sourced mainly from Chicago designers as well as independent designers from Minnesota and Canada. The sweater that took my heart and $80 is from Quebecois designer Sheila Couture and is part of her SHiliconfeETTI collection. The designs were inspired by the city of Barcelona. Holland and Himalaya are two other Shiliconfetti collections, all made in Quebec. \r</p>\n<p>I have long since sworn off buying neutrals or one color tops, vowing only to purchase prints full of colors. This, however, has been quite difficult as most of what I see is yet another solid neutral color to add to my already stuffed collection.  My Shiliconfetti sweater is not only fun to say, but the use of bright colors, three different prints on the sweater and varying colored stripes along the edges is a feat of great design, likely due to the designer’s background in graphic design. In addition, the thoughtful description on the tag describes the inspiration. It reads, “Pixels of lemons and ceramic flowers become a mosaic garden. Vitamins of Barcelona inspire flamenco passion and dance around to become the tapestry of a chic evening…” Who can resist such care and beautiful imagery? Not me, of course. I wanted lemon and flower pixels to join together and dance around with me in my Chicago evenings. I easily and gladly parted with the sum because this was a sweater that I could tell I was going to live with happily ever after.\r</p>\n\n<p>Renewed with hope that bold color and print did exist in Chicago shops for reasonable prices, I continued my exploration of Milk. There was no shortage of local talent—Midwest is Best tees by Megan Lee Designs, dresses by Wulfka, sportswear by Anna Hovet and scarves and blouses by another Chicago designer Sophia Reyes. Although none of these screamed out to me like the Shiliconfetti sweater, they showcased the variety of Chicago design and that was enjoyable to see. Milk is eclectic in its tastes and that’s what makes it distinctly Chicago. A mash-up of neighborhoods and people makes for an interesting array of attire. \r</p>\n<p>A local designer, Lydia Crespo whose label Argaman & Defiance, did stand out. I loved her raw silk crop top, loose fitting and hand-dyed top whose gold speckle on black made it look like a tiny galaxy. The last bit that I adored but didn’t purchase were winter gloves by French Knot, Massachusetts-designed and handmade in Nepal. These gloves were also in lovely prints and bright colors, leaving combinations of blue and yellow, pink and orange floating around in my head. I may have to go back sooner rather than later.  \r</p>\n\n<p>\rPrints and colors aside, Milk has filled a fashion gap in Andersonville. While the stretch of Clark St. north and south of Foster boasts great bars, restaurants, and furniture shops, there isn’t too much going on in the garment section. Turley Road up the street from Milk is another well-curated shop, although for a different type of wallet. The polyester heaven of an Akira, well I’ve said enough about that. It’s simply not of the same caliber. \r</p>\n<p>\rAlthough the amount that I spent on a sweater may seem like too much for some Chicagoans, I would like all of us to consider not just the amount we spend, but how and when we will wear the garment, and how it makes us feel. If something truly brings joy, then it will likely be worn often. I’m adhering to the motto of purchasing less but purchasing quality, and as silly as the name sounds, this Shiliconfetti sweater is well made and makes my joy flutter all around and upside down. \r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">\n 2108 N Damen<br>\n Bucktown, Chicago\n</h5>\n\n<p>If the large, wiry mesh sphere, resembling an immense rubber-band ball, were the only marker to Robin Richman’s eponymous boutique, that would be enough. Much of the clothing, accessories, and jewelry inside Robin Richman evoke this sculpture. Garments from around the globe, outwardly fragile barrettes, and bracelets and earrings in various metals seem to be relations of the sculpture that hangs outside of the unassuming storefront. \n</p>\n<p>In business for almost 20 years, the shop opened in 1997. Richman’s selections resonate with a particular type of customer who is interested in unconventional and daring fashions.  Richman, whose welcoming smile and spirited disposition was not something I initially associated with the owner of an avant-garde clothing boutique, vaguely remembered me from Andrea Reynders’ trunk show in November and agreed to let me take photos of her unique space. Richman was a designer of chunky, hand-knit accessories for 18 years, after studying textiles at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Today, she curates and owns what is easily the hottest boutique in Chicago.  \n</p>\n<p>The boutique carries men’s and women’s clothing from obscure designers none of whom I was familiar with but whom, if my wallet allowed, I would love to get to know. The first piece that struck me upon entrance was a blush-colored tunic from Eckhaus Latta, designers from New York. The garment is called Powder Smock and can be worn as a tunic or a dress, long-sleeved and perfect for transitional seasons like spring. Made in the USA is a rarity these days, but this smock is a prime example of what quality workmanship from innovative designs can be in the US. The price tag, like most at the boutique, is hefty, ($388 for the Powder Smock), but if price isn’t a consideration, then better to spend at Robin Richman than any shop on North Michigan Avenue. \n</p>\n<p>As I had been in to the shop once before for Andrea Reynders’ trunk show, I knew which items were at my price point: vintage French barrettes in a glass case by the cash register. I quickly located a pink Lucite barrette to match my springtime punky hair and mood When the barrette was 20% off for a spring sale, I thought, well today’s my lucky day. The comment the shop assistant made to me after I had chosen the barrette cemented my belief in my newfound state of luck. “You may have heard it before, but you look a bit like Charlotte Gainsbourg,” she said.  I laughed and said that I had heard it before, but not for some time, and it was an honor to hear this comparison. Floating on the wings of the Gainsbourg legacy, I continued my exploration of this shop, which can feel like a cultural museum as every piece is so carefully chosen, cared for, and displayed. \n</p>\n<p>A small curio cabinet of exquisitely colored glass rings and other jewels stands near the threshold that separates the men’s clothing from the women’s. In the men’s section, the colors are darker, the materials still lightweight. The arrangement throughout the shop forces one to stop and take in entire sections, as they are made for looking, standing back to appreciate the way one does at a museum or art gallery. I was forced to stop and stare at a Walter Van Beirendonck men’s shirt, printed all over with tiny red, pink, and blue mushrooms, and priced at $298. Colored into this wonder of a men’s shirt, I got lost in the fairytale and only snapped out of it when Richman walked by and commented that she loved my blue suede boots. Speaking of boots, there are several amazing pairs of shoes by Guidi; faint pink front-zip boots, and open-toed oxfords of the same shade. \n</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about a 1991 Wim Wenders’ documentary<em> Notebook on Cities and Clothes</em>, about the Japanese clothes designer Yohji Yamamoto. In it, Yamamoto describes how he liked to look at the photos in August Sander’s book <em>Citizens of the Twentieth Century</em> because he thought you could match the person’s profession to their clothing. I have since checked out the book to see what he was talking about and it’s true. In the section on manufacturers, for example, the men who share this profession do resemble one another, so do the farmers too, the artists too, and so on. \n</p>\n<p>While at Robin Richman, I wondered how the women and men who wore these garments would be labeled in a book on citizens of the twenty-first century, so I decided to pretend if income weren’t a concern in profession, what profession some of these garments could refer to. I think most certainly the Powder Smock would be worn by an artist, a dancer or, perhaps, a writer. The Barbara Bologna Fly Print dress, which is worn like a superhero’s cape, with the back left to fly loose, would belong to category of mother, mostly due to the ease of mobility that mothers need. The men’s mushroom shirt would have to belong to a farmer, a scientist, or a psychologist. Guessing games aside, this boutique is meant for perusing, smiling at the whimsical clothes, and remembering that we are what we wear. So, as citizens of the twenty-first century let’s choose wisely. \n</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">\n830 N Michigan<br>\nStreeterville, Chicago\n</h4>\n\n<p>Since Uniqlo, the Japanese clothing retailer, landed in Chicago in October 2015, I have made a few trips up the escalator to the colorful glass box that houses the store.  A linen men’s shirt, two cotton t-shirts, a black fleece skirt, a basic button-down shirt, a V-neck, mock-neck, and turtle neck merino sweaters, and a navy trench coat have made up my purchases. While initially excited about the prospect of casual sportswear at affordable prices in a range of colors, a seemingly perfect combination for the Midwest, I have quickly grown bored in the Uniqloset. \r</p>\n<p>The navy trench is a favorite, along with the merino turtleneck and fleece skirt, but the more I read on fast fashion, in particular Elizabeth Cline’s <em>Overdressed</em>, the less I want to spend at these giant producers. Mainly I am concerned about the working conditions of the people making these garments and I am too skeptical to trust Uniqlo’s social responsibility promises found on their website. While I hope these few pieces last me a few more seasons, I am wary, as the merino turtleneck has already started to show signs of wear. I have also grown more interested in supporting independent designers and am slowly steering myself away from large retailers. \r</p>\n<p>The store sits in the space of the unforgettable bargain basement, Filene’s. At Filene’s the motto was to expect the unexpected. The racks could offer everything from a Dolce & Gabbana white button-down to a Helmut Lang blazer, or just a hot mess. Joy or disappointment were part of the adventure of shopping at Filene’s. The retail space, which had until recently been empty since Filene’s closed in 2012, is now part of a new breed of shopping experience.   \r</p>\n<p>Founded in 1984 in Japan by wealthy Japanese businessman Tadashi Yani, Uniqlo is quickly catching up to the likes of H&M and Zara. Now with stores in 14 countries, Uniqlo is owned by Fast Retailing Co., Ltd., which also owns several other brands, including Theory and Comptoir des Cotonniers. Although a large retailer, Uniqlo sets itself apart from stores like H&M and Zara by its attention to fabric while ignoring adherence to the latest trends. While the majority of H&M and Zara’s fabrics are synthetics, such as polyester and acrylic, Uniqlo is also full of natural fibers: merino and lambswool, cashmere, and cotton. \r</p>\n<p>A unique yet unified uniform appears to be the formula at Uniqlo. A leisurely ride up the glowing escalator offers the first glimpse into the Uniqloset; mannequins dressed in various garments stand in the middle, separating the up and down escalators. The music is soft, the space is clean and open, comfortable, not like that time I walked into a Forever 21 to see what all the fuss was about and couldn’t find my way out for all the crowds, loud music, and mess everywhere. Uniqlo’s decor is modern, organized, and neat. The first floor is devoted to women’s clothing and any special collections, like the Uniqlo and Lemaire (former Hermès designer Christophe Lemaire) collaboration or the recent project with Liberty of London.  The second floor carries men’s and children’s clothing, while the third offers additional outerwear, a café and lounging area.\r</p>\n<p>I first visited a week after the grand opening October 23, late afternoon on a Friday. The 60,000-square-foot space did not overwhelm, it simply welcomed. My main area of interest lay at the first floor women’s department. Here, the attention that Uniqlo gives to fabrics is immediately evident; softness surrounded me. From cashmere and merino wool to fleece, I couldn’t stop touching the garments.  What the clothes lacked in print or variety of style, they made up for in fiber. As I am fond of limits when shopping, at each visit I went with a goal in mind: this time, from a black sweater this time to a navy trench coat to linen shirt for my brother on later visits. Without set boundaries in mind, fast-fashion retailers can be a drain on the wallet and psyche.  </p>\n<p>Uniqlo abounds with basics, from sweats to cardigans to turtlenecks. Basics are a necessary backbone to any wardrobe. They can be useful in layering, breaking up a busy palette, or creating a monochromatic one. At my initial visit I was in need of a basic black turtleneck to complete my Halloween costume: a beatnik/black panther/spy. So I chose several black turtlenecks from the Lemaire collaboration, the Inès de la Fressange collection, and Uniqlo’s own, deciding in the end upon the merino wool Lemaire turtleneck, for a mere $29.90. Clean and soft, it had the right amount of cling to the body, would serve me well beyond Halloween, and it has. \r</p>\n<p>As Chicagoans, we are all in one way or another preparing for the winter, whether prepping our closets or getting in all the outdoor time we can before the cold hits. With winter in mind during my first visit to Uniqlo, I took a look at the down coats. At $149, I wondered, How warm could they be? The length was excellent, just what I was looking for, below the knee, but not a maxi coat. Then came the question about the down fill, How much goose down and feathers would be warming me in this coat? I am a label reader when it comes to food and clothing, a skill learned from the school of my mother, a person that I can always lean on. \r</p>\n<p>The coat’s label was rather misleading; it read 53% down in the outer chamber, and then (minimum 80% down). Unfortunately the sale’s associate’s explanation did not clarify the matter. I learned that the coat was 53% down with the remaining 27% dispersed throughout the outer chamber of the coat, to achieve the minimum 80%. As the rest of the filling was polyester, I decided that it was simply not enough geese for me, but I was pleased that my request for label explanation was not met with a smirk, but with an attempt to clarify. Later in the winter, I ended up purchasing a knee-length Soia & Kyo down coat. Their labels are easy to read, 80% down, 20% feathers, and as I already have a shorter down coat from them, I trust the durability and warmth of the brand. \r</p>\n<p>Although Uniqlo’s products cater to the midwestern sensibility for comfort, utility, and warmth, they cannot stand alone. One-stop shops may exist, but a one-stop style should not be the end result. It is often easier in our busy schedules to go to one shop and buy all that we need, but quality can be lost in this way. I have a particular grocer for my vegetables and another for my grains or meats. While it may be more time consuming to go to separate shops for these items, the quality and freshness are worth it. I will likely make more visits to Uniqlo, but always with an intention. Boutiques are made for lingering and appreciating, while large retailers are more for necessity shopping. Mixing Uniqlo’s basics with more striking cuts of fabric or prints from smaller shops is key to differentiating one’s garment collection. \r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">\n3860 N Lincoln<br>\nNorth Center, Chicago\n</h5>\n\n<p>For someone who can barely stitch a straight line by hand, anything hand sewn, hand embroidered, or handmade has always fascinated me. My hands do better with less delicate tasks, like writing with a pen or keyboard, odd jobs around the house and, of course, piecing together the puzzles of Ikea furniture. The women makers that form the boutique of Union Handmade are women who are adept with their hands and creative minds. From the open and closed sign that hangs on the door, carefully embroidered by Nancy Melvin, to the dresses and shirts found inside the shop, Union Handmade offers a truly unique boutique experience in a quiet neighborhood on the north side of Chicago.\r</p>\n<p>Browsing in Chicago boutiques is often a great way to enjoy a bit of the outdoors, while still being able to warm up when needed. Small business Saturday was a sunny but brisk day last November 28, and seemed like an appropriate day to go for a long walk and visit Union Handmade for the second time. The boutique is run like a co-op by its eleven members, who all pitch in, from welcoming customers to collaborating on projects with one another. \r</p>\n<p>Union Handmade opened in 2013 and provides the steady collection of founder Leigh DeLeonardo’s airy jackets, dresses, tunics, and coats, alongside special-occasion dresses, handmade by Holly Greenhagen, another Chicago designer. There are about fifteen different designers represented at Union Handmade, mainly from the Midwest and some from Brooklyn. From chunky knits to loose-fitting tunics, the aesthetic oozes comfort, quality of fabric, and singularity in design. \r</p>\n<p>The shop invites thoughtfully and quietly, as all the senses are slowly activated in the feel of the wools and other natural fibers, the sounds of light music, and the sight of the clearly organized tables and racks. Taste and smell were activated soon after entering when I was offered warm apple cider and cookies. At this second visit I had a mission: a chain necklace and circular pendant with an initial engraved for an old friend’s upcoming birthday, at a reasonable price of $25. My belly full and hands warmed up, I searched the jewelry table for the necklace. I found the “J” initial I was searching for, but it was in brass and I needed the rosy colored pendant. Sure there were options I could’ve gotten, those reading “bestie” or “babe” that I’m sure my friend would’ve enjoyed, but they simply didn’t satisfy my idea for the perfect birthday gift. \r</p>\n<p>The beauty of a boutique like Union Handmade is that you can talk to the shop owner or designers directly. I mentioned to Leigh what I was looking for and she said that it was no problem for her to call Katie Mills, the designer of Lady Faye Jewelry, and ask if she had any “J” pendants in her studio. Ten minutes later, everything was arranged, my copper pendant with necklace from Lady Faye Jewelry would arrive the following day. Experiences like this one help to create community; not only does it sustain a community economically but it also fosters solidarity, which kept me coming back to the shop for some springtime visits as well. \r</p>\n<p>On later visits to the shop, I grew more acquainted with the specialties of the various designers.  Although I had no plan for purchasing, as all of my clothing funds had gone towards a new dress in celebration of completing my M.A. studies, I intended to select a few choice items that I would hypothetically purchase, many of which I photographed. I started from the back, with the rack of reduced items, where my eyes fell upon a brown checked tunic or popover as it was labeled, by Auntie Oti, and marked down to $69. The 100% cotton khadi, a hand-woven fabric made from hand-spun yarn from India, is the designer Susan Hahn’s specialty. The popover was soft to the touch, and I pictured it over jeans, or leggings; it was classic yet had this “Little House on the Prairie” feel to it. As a lover of this television series and the Laura Ingalls Wilder books, I thought this checked tunic could be worn casually across either concrete or grass fields. \r</p>\n<p>\rAlso on the reduced rack were two fluttery silk dresses from Nancy Melvin, made from Habutai silk, priced at $168; the luscious wine color and brighter lavender were perfect for summertime strolling. Melvin’s label, which reads “Made Here,” made me think about traveling, if I were in Detroit with this same dress, how would it read then? Would it still be made in Chicago? Undoubtedly the cleverest label I’ve seen. \r</p>\n<p>Moving away from the sale rack, I quickly began crushing on garments from DeLeonardo’s collection and Union, her collaboration with Jamie LaPorta. My first crush was the “Envelope” dress by Leigh DeLeonardo, a linen wonder of a dress. It was in fact, like an envelope, with a button seal in the back and another in the front, two basic methods of closure that worked to create a bluish-gray beauty. Another favorite was the Union folded skirt, at $143. This plaid cotton skirt, which may not sound too appealing in words, but everything is in the details at Union Handmade. First, the plaid is small black and gray squares that are cut through with orange lines, creating a vibrancy. The centerfold transforms the piece from a skirt to a moving object, adding dimension and interest.\r</p>\n<p>Each time I go to this shop, I uncover some new layer, whether the arrival of spring collections from the designers, or learning something new about how one of the designers works and creates. Although the majority of the price points are too high for me, the garments and designers are deserving of them as they combine craftsmanship with elegance. \r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h1><em>Cutting-Edge Fashion: Recent Acquisitions</em></h1>\n<h4>Through January 3, 2016</h4>\n<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>Pioneering fashion is generally not associated with Indianapolis. Football games and automobile races seem to be more in line with Indiana’s capital city. So, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the Indianapolis Museum of Art was hosting <em>Cutting-Edge Fashion</em> in its textile gallery during my midwestern fashion tour. \r</p>\n<p><em>Cutting-Edge Fashion</em> showcased recently acquired garments from pioneering American, European, and Japanese designers. Although the exhibit was organized chronologically, beginning with garments from the 1920s and culminating in the early 2000s, it was by no means dull or traditional. These garments on display were truly avant-garde in their time, and some would still be considered so today. The chronological set-up was useful, helping the visitor to view the trajectory of what constituted cutting edge in different time periods. \r</p>\n<p>While Claire McCardell’s cotton dress and playsuit, from around 1950, would not be seen as innovative for today’s time, presented in the context of this exhibit, the visitor learned that McCardell was one of the pioneers of the American look. When Dior was perfecting the hourglass look with the use of corsets and girdles, designers like Claire McCardell were creating less-structured silhouettes, although still following the general outline of Dior’s designs. Her plaid dress, for example, provided movement and comfort while the cinched waist still created the desired feminine shape of the time. Compared with Dior’s red evening dress that stands on the same platform, McCardell’s garments reflect the casual style that American women have become known for and which designers have perfected throughout the decades. But it is likely that a modern woman of the 1950s would have worn McCardell in the daytime, while strolling in the park, and Dior’s dress in the evening, dining with her beau. \r</p>\n<p>If McCardell’s unstructured garments were ignoring the French structure, then Rudi Gernreich’s were outright defying any set rules that were defined by French fashions of the time. Gernreich’s loose-fitting wool dresses and sexy bathing suits from the mid- 1960s set their own criteria for fashion, challenging the status quo. While Dior had his “New Look,” Gernreich gave women his “Total Look,” consisting of a knit dress with a matching stocking, the line from the dress seamlessly flowing into the line on the stocking, allowing the “dress to be an accessory” as Gernreich would often say. \r</p>\n<p>Bill Blass’s stunning red evening dress showed the more elegant side of American fashion. The dress seemed to be made from continuous loops of the most luxurious thread, creating a clingy red syrup of a dress.  Where McCardell brought mobility and Gernreich innovation, Blass was surely bringing sex appeal.  While I was photographing the dress, a museum guard struck up a conversation with me. After I told him of my midwestern tour de fashion, he informed me that Bill Blass was not only from Indiana, but there was an interesting documentary that I should watch, <em>The Ghost Army</em>, about Blass’ time in World War II, which shows how he worked with other soldiers to create dummy tanks amongst other creative concoctions to fool the Nazis. Cutting-edge began to become more than the garments on display, as the personalities behind these risky fashions exhibited similar qualities in their personal lives. \r</p>\n<p>Works by European and Japanese designers dominated the second room of the gallery, including works by French designer Jean Charles de Castelbajac. The two coats on display from the 1990s were whimsical and vividly colored, reminding me of the de Castelbajac dress I saw at my school’s fashion resource center, in the same bright orange as the coat now on display. Orange is a rough color to wear; I’ve made a few attempts in my life, but have never been fully converted to the orange side. But this de Castelbajac coat succeeded in opening me up again to orange. The pockets on it were absolutely ridiculous, and I mean that in the best way possible. As a huge fan of pockets, I’ve ignored many a jacket or pant because of improper or lacking pockets. I was overjoyed to see that this coat had two pockets on each sleeve and two on each side of the coat. And these weren’t any regular pockets, but almost like mini bags. I have several purses the size of these pockets. But if I had this coat, a purse I would not need. It is practicality taken to the point of absurdity and that is what makes it risky, and worthy of being in this exhibit.  \r</p>\n<p>There were several Vivienne Westwood garments on display, the Boob-Tube Sweater being my favorite, again in a shade of orange. Moschino, McQueen, Galliano, Margiela represented the rest of Europe on three platforms, while the Japanese Fashion Revolution, as the exhibit panel named it, had its own lengthy platform, from which was showcased Issey Miyake, Rei Kawakubo for Comme des Garçons, Junya Watanabe for Comme des Garçons, and Yohji Yamamoto. Kawakubo’s infamous “Bump” collection was on view, the bumps interacting with the contours and curves of the body when worn. Definitely a risky garment for the average woman, who has enough bumps and curves without added pillows, but it would be an amusing piece to try on at the very least. Another fun piece from Kawakubo was a white crop top with matching leggings, with hands sewn on the hips and breasts. The bunny ears hat was designed by Stephen Jones and makes the whole thing look like a playboy bunny being fondled. \r</p>\n<p>Wearability is not so much at stake here, but the Japanese spirit of going beyond proposed fashion limits shines in this selection of garments. The two-piece dress by Junya Watanabe for Comme des Garçons was the one of the rare pieces that I wanted to walk out in. It retains the deconstructed aesthetic of many Japanese designers, with the ragged hem of the tweed skirt and the waist pierced with large safety pins, making the skirt feel undone. While the classic navy-and-white striped top pays homage to Chanel’s 1917 Breton top in her nautical collection, it surpasses any direct appropriation as the neckline is knotted and threaded together with a large set of pearls, rebellious and proper at once. \r</p>\n<p>Risk is always necessary—in art, in fashion, in life. The work of the designers in this exhibit is what moved fashion into its next phase, forced it out of its comfort zone. Fashion designers like McCardell, Kawakubo, Gernreich, and Watanabe have been like fortune tellers in a way, forecasting where a women’s next step will be before she even knows it herself, offering the right outfit for her chosen path. \r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h2><em>Fashion Timeline:</em> <h5>June 29, 2012&ndash;June 24, 2018</h5></h2>\n<h2><em>Flapper Style: 1920s Fashion:</em> <h5>September 25, 2015&ndash;September 4, 2016</h5></h2>\n<h2><em>Inside Out: Revealing Clothing’s Hidden Secrets:</em> <h5>March 12, 2015&ndash;July 31, 2016</h5></h2>\n\n<h3>By Ana Sekler</h3>\n<p>Museums devoted to fashion are few and far between in the U.S., especially in the Midwest. The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, both in New York, are the oldest and most esteemed. While Chicago schools like Columbia College and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago offer fashion study collections and resource centers, they do not present regular exhibitions of interest to the general public. The Kent State University Museum (KSUM), however, is a hidden treasure trove of fashion delights at the easternmost limits of the Midwest, in Kent, Ohio.  \n</p>\n<p>KSUM has been exhibiting, collecting, presenting and preserving fashion and decorative arts since 1985. Now numbering over 20,000 objects, the collection began in 1982 with generous gifts by Shannon Rodgers, a native Ohioan fashion designer, and Jerry Silverman, a New York businessman. The two were partners in Jerry Silverman Inc., one of the most successful ready-to-wear firms in the latter half of the 20th century on New York’s famous Seventh Avenue. The collection of costume, decorative arts, and books, worth around $5 million, was donated to Kent State University, which in turn agreed to build a museum to house the artifacts. In addition to the collection from Rodgers and Silverman, KSUM received Oscar de la Renta’s 1982 collection, as well a 700-piece collection of performance costumes from Katharine Hepburn. Both of those collections have been exhibited at various times throughout the museum’s history. Some of the garments from the Oscar de la Renta collection are currently on loan to San Francisco’s de Young Museum for their retrospective exhibit on the designer, explains Sara Hume, curator at KSUM. \n</p>\n<p>Current exhibits at KSUM include <em>Fashion Timeline</em>, <em>Inside Out: Revealing Clothing’s Hidden Secrets</em>, and <em>Flapper Style: 1920s Fashion</em>, all carefully curated by Hume.\nOn the first floor of the museum is the <em>Fashion Timeline</em> exhibit, which showcases fashion history from 1750–1950, a grand feat that never feels overwhelming.  The garments are clearly marked following a timeline on the wall that also presents important moments in history, in order to contextualize the style of the garments and show their evolution.  For example, the development of the sewing machine in 1845 by Elias Howe marks the end of the section devoted to the first half of the 1800s and signals the beginning of the democratization of fashion in the second half of the century. The movement to machine-made garments coincided with the birth of the department store in the latter half of the 19th century. While ready-to-wear garments were readily adopted for men, the late 1800s also saw the birth of haute couture in Charles Frederick Worth’s dress designs in Paris.\n</p>\n<p>A stark, plain day suit in wool welcomes the visitor to the 20th century, a marked contrast to earlier styles that coincides with the establishment of the Bauhaus in 1918 and the ratification of the 19th amendment, which secured women’s right to vote in 1920. This move towards less ornament in women’s fashion echoes the sentiment of Adolf Loos, Austrian architect, theorist, and author of <em>Ornament and Crime</em>. In his essay “Ladies’ Fashion (1898/1902),” Loos concludes with, “[B]ut we are heading toward a newer, greater age. Women will no longer have to appeal to sensuality to achieve equal status with men, but will do so through their economic and intellectual independence, gained through work. … Silks and satins, ribbons and bows, frills and furbelows will lose their effectiveness.” Corsets and petticoats are altogether abandoned after World War I. The exhibit ends with the 1930s–50s, with loose matching cotton dresses for mother and daughter from 1940, echoing Loos’ s prediction forty years earlier. \n</p>\n<p>Although the <em>Fashion Timeline</em> exhibit is historically accurate and varied, it is contained in a fairly small gallery space and does not prepare one for the pizazz on the second floor in the Broadbent Gallery, exuded by <em>Flapper Style</em>. When I went early on a Wednesday morning, the gallery was empty, allowing for space, light, and awe. My jaw dropped when I entered. The rows of stunningly dressed mannequins were backed by mirrors that for the first few minutes tricked me into believing there was a multitude more hidden in another room. As with <em>Fashion Timeline</em>, Hume looks beyond the garments to the social and political environment that shaped them. “I’m a historian, so I’m interested in the social aspect, like with the Flapper exhibit, which examines the changes in women’s lives and how that was reflected in the garments,” says the curator. Not swayed by Diana Vreeland’s belief that the fashion exhibit must be entertaining above all, Hume is just as concerned with historical accuracy and the educational role that an exhibit plays. \n</p>\n<p>Hume contextualizes each moment in history for the visitor. The flapper is described as bold and independent: “This flapper has forgotten how to simper; she seldom blushes; it is impossible to shock her.” And the dresses on view in front of this particular text personify it. The copper and gold beaded headdresses must have created sounds to accompany the era’s jazz music and the flapper’s movements. The loose silhouettes defied earlier rules of strict corsetry and redefined women’s fashion. The flapper was elegant and rebellious. She didn’t whimper and neither do her dresses, they cheer and celebrate. \n</p>\n<p>Smart and sophisticated, 1920’s fashion exhibited early characteristics of sportswear. As attention to physical fitness increased (and the sneaker rose to prominence), casual wear became more acceptable. Two of my favorite outfits in the exhibit were, in fact, not proper garments but gym suits, one a wool gym uniform, consisting of a black wool jumper with a white shirt underneath from the Kent State Normal School, and the other black bloomers with a white day shirt.  Perhaps because they mark the beginnings of sportswear, and I had just come from viewing the <em>Sneaker Culture</em> exhibit in Toledo, or maybe because I value all-American comfort so much, these gym suits especially resonated with me and the current sportswear aesthetic.\n</p>\n<p>Engaging with garments as art objects in a museum setting changes them in some way. Whether historical garments as in these current exhibits at KSUM, or contemporary designs, like those curated by Diana Vreeland or Richard Martin and Harold Koda, the question “Is fashion art?” will continue to be asked. To this, I can only offer a quote from Roland Barthes in “The Contest between Chanel and Courrèges. Refereed by a Philosopher,” where he says: “We have to believe that society needs this contest, because society has been ingenious at launching it—at least for the last few centuries—in all domains of art, and in an infinite variety of forms; and if we now see it clearly breaking into fashion, it is because fashion too is also an art, in the same way as literature, painting and music are.”\n</p>\n<p>The third fashion exhibit on view at the KSUM was <em>Inside Out: Revealing Clothing’s Hidden Secrets</em>, in which the garments on view were shown from the inside out, revealing the secret inner-workings that usually go unseen. The garments chosen, all remarkably intact, span the 18th through 20th centuries. While my sewing skills haven’t progressed beyond hemming, this exhibit would surely be a delight for those who do understand the craft of sewing, as close inspection of some of the garments shows where they have been altered. For example, an examination of the lining of the Robe à l’anglaise from the 1770s shows places where seams were taken out. Loose stitching was typical of this period, as dresses were often updated and modified as styles changed. \n</p>\n<p>The most interesting garment to view from the inside out for me was a pair of men’s breeches from the 1780s. I finally learned how those dapper gentlemen would remove their breeches, or at least how they could relieve themselves, via a front flap that buttoned on. The rear of the breeches was also quite amusing as it consisted of a fullness of material, perhaps intended to allow for ease in movement. Hume suggests that the fullness may have been due to the long shirts that men wore, so the space in the breeches would allow for the shirt to be tucked in properly. The numerous flaps and panels on the breeches form three pockets on each side, although they don’t appear bulky by any means. “<em>Inside Out </em>takes a different look; it’s showing how the garments are made and put together, showing aspects that you don’t get to see. That’s a different way of thinking about fashion as an object, as a craft, as a product, versus thinking about it as an aesthetic,” says Hume. \n</p>\n<p>The Kent State University Museum has some odds against it; for one it is situated outside a large city, in a small college-town. What it lacks in a centralized location, though, it makes up for in the scale and quality of its exhibitions. “Looking at fashion as an aesthetic is certainly an approach, but it can also be looked at as a garment that links to history, that was owned by someone, and had some relation to their life,” says Hume. Perhaps, it is KSUM’s unique location that allows for its particular approach in exhibiting fashion and garments as more than just art objects, but as a history, a skill, and a cultural gesture. \n</p>\n\n",

Fined: The Past, Present, and Future of Detroit Fashion</em></h1>\n<h5>September 11, 2015&ndash;December 31, 2016</h5>\n<h2>Detroit Historical Society</h2>\n<h3>By Ana Nezna</h3>\n<p>Slowly rising from the ashes of its bankruptcy, Detroit is a city on the move that knows how to honor the richness of its history and to promote its future.  From the Motown Museum and Diego Rivera murals at the Detroit Institute of Art to the hidden museum devoted to the city’s techno music roots, I’ve always enjoyed uncovering yet another layer of culture on visits to the Motor City. \r</p>\n<p>Museum exhibitions on fashion are fairly uncommon outside of New York, but more and more cultural institutions are overlooking fashion’s assumed frivolity in order to present it actively and sincerely through various kinds of exhibits. In December 2015, when I arrived at my first stop, Detroit, for Touring Chic, the city was presenting the exhibit <em>Fashion D.Fined: The Past, Present, and Future of Detroit Fashion</em> at the Detroit Historical Museum.\r</p>\n<p><em>Fashion D.Fined </em>was a fantastic exhibit, thoughtfully curated and stunning for the eyes.  The exhibit showcased fashion in Detroit in a few ways. First, there were sections devoted to several renowned designers who hail from Detroit, including Anna Sui, John Varvatos, and Tracy Reese. Sprinkled throughout were contemporary local designers among them the Detroit Denim Co., Ann Yee, and Bridget Sullivan.  Finally, a brief look into Detroit fashion and shops was organized by decade from the 1940s to present-day.  \r</p>\n<p>Jin, the Detroiter who joined me for these visits couldn’t tear herself away from the Anna Sui garments on exhibit, and rightly so. Sui, who grew up in Metro Detroit, carried that midwestern spirit to New York for studies and internationally later in her career. She created her own clothing line in 1981, starting with five pieces, and her first runway show in 1991 rocked her to the top. \r</p>\n<p>The spirit of creativity, no frills, hard work, determination, and skill fed Sui as it does  many contemporary Detroiters. We couldn’t stop oohing and drooling over her dresses, picking favorites, imagining what they felt like, what they would look like on our own bodies. All three garments had high collars, and were extensively patterned, something both of us adore, as evidenced by my friend Jin’s swan-printed leggings.  Sui’s patterns were floral. My favorite was the shorter dress with the beige lace bodice and vibrant skirt, whose pattern reminded me of the needlepoint work in my aunt’s house. Jin’s favorite was the longer dress, patterned in florals of rich blues and greens with loose sleeves in another floral motif, a Bohemian dress to go with the flow of her roles as artist and DJ. \r</p>\n<p>Although it was spectacular to see garments by legendary designers like Sui and Varvatos, the exhibit was formidable in its attention to the current fashion scene and in paying homage to the past. I was surprised to learn of the many fashion events that happen in Detroit, like the WALK Fashion Show, which presents designers and models with a focus on diversity, including models of various sizes and ethnic backgrounds, which took place on May 22, 2016. \r</p>\n<p>The two dresses on display from Detroit artist Bridget Sullivan were ethereal, belonging to a modern-day English garden party. Sturdy dresses with floral embellishments, color, and distinct form; they fold up on themselves, mimicking movement while standing still. Jin’s favorite item in the whole exhibit was the mint green Sullivan dress with a mauve underskirt and flowers. While not my favorite of the exhibit, I was taken aback by the designer’s black dress with small orange flower decorations. The flowers did not appear decorative at all, but entirely necessary, and the bottom layer under the skirt helped to create movement. The dress was an example of ornament with a purpose.  Adolf Loos, who famously said, “the evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornamentation from objects in everyday use,” in his 1929 essay “Ornament and Crime,” may have even enjoyed this dress, though it is by no means for everyday.  \r</p>\n<p><em>Fashion D.Fined</em> paid homage to Detroit designers, local shops, and the oft-forgotten fashion writer. At my first visit to the city’s Belle Isle Park, I was drawn to an obelisk like statue, protected by a small fence. It appeared like a little castle, some dream world. There was a miniature creek that encircled the tower and upon closer inspection, I learned that it was erected in honor of Nancy Brown—a journalist known for her “Experience” advice column for the <em>Detroit News</em>—around 1919. Detroit does not have the excessive pride that other cities do; it is honest and dignified in its boasting. <em>Fashion D. Fined</em> presents a few fashion writers who began their careers at the <em>Detroit News</em>: Charlotte “Tavy” Stone who began freelancing there in the 1960s, Marji Kunz who also wrote for the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> in the 1960s; and Cathy Horyn, who wrote for the <em>Detroit News</em> in 1986, and today is the fashion critic for <em>New York Magazine’s</em> web publication <em>The Cut</em>; and Robin Givhan who was at the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, and is now fashion editor at <em>The Washington Post</em>. As an admirer of Cathy Horyn’s decisive words, and an aspiring fashion writer myself, I felt a surge of hope and inspiration while reading this particular placard at the exhibit. \r</p>\n<p>Define, display, decode, and dedicate; <em>Fashion D. Fined</em> does them all in the span of two large rooms at the Booth-Wilkinson Gallery in the Detroit Historical Museum. This exhibit, like so much that the city of Detroit produces is carefully thought out, extensive, and forward thinking. “Fashions fade, style is eternal,” read a quote by Yves Saint Laurent stenciled on one of the exhibit walls. In a similar spirit, I dare say, economies fade, but a city’s heart is eternal.\r</p>\n",

          "HTML": "<h1>The Rise of Sneaker Culture</h1>\n<h4>December 3, 2015–February 28, 2016</h4>\n<h3>By Ana Nezna</h3>\n<p>For as long as I’ve known myself, I’ve known my sneakers. The choices I made or that were made for me throughout the span of my childhood, adolescence, and adult life have formed my sense of self. My first memory of the beloved sneaker is from around the age of five. My brother, older by two years, had learned of Michael Jordan and coveted that first pair of Air Jordan’s.  As freshly arrived immigrants to Chicago in the early 1980s, my mother could by no means afford those fresh red, black, and white high-top gym shoes. Fortunately, she was a savvy shopper at Zayre or K-mart, and located a look-alike knock-off for both of us.  They were our first high-tops, and they were a pain to put on and take off, but all the same, they were our “Jordan’s” and we treasured them. \n</p>\n<p>After that first taste of sneaker comfort and ease, I chose my own pairs at the local Fayva; I rode a white and pink pair of Pony’s through the ages of seven and eight. After that, L.A. Gear hit the scene and I had to have those ultra-girly yet super-sporty kicks.  After those initial fake Jordan’s, my brother and I never wore the same shoes again, he grew into a tried and true Nike devotee while I wavered from Pony to Reebok, eventually settling on Nike during my pre-teen angst. \n</p>\n<p>Sneakers were a way that kids defined themselves at public schools in Chicago; they could make you or break you. Being a tomboyish twelve-year-old, I chose the most masculine looking Nike mid-tops in my size. They may have even been boy’s shoes. Those gym shoes made me feel strong at a time when everything was changing; they offered me a sense of stability and allowed me to remain a child, free of the crushes on boys that so many of my friends were facing. I was in no hurry to grow up; in fact, I hated the whole process, and those shoes were my protection. At my K-8 school on the northwest side, everyone fit in at that age; girls who wore makeup and liked boys and those who wore sneakers and still played on the monkey bars. \n</p>\n<p>Twenty years later, my friend, DJ Moppy, with whom I had been staying while in Detroit to view the <em>D.Fined</em> exhibit, mentioned that he was invited to perform in January with fellow Detroiters, guitarist Ryan Gimpert and MC Josef Coney Island for for the museum’s bash as part of <em>The Rise of Sneaker Culture</em> exhibit at the Toledo Museum of Art. I looked down at my current sneakers of choice, hi-top purple suede Puma’,s and thought, “Toledo is on my way to Kent!” \n</p>\n<p>In a <em>Fashion Theory Journal</e,> article, “Museum Quality: The Rise of the Fashion Exhibition,” from 2008, editor-in-chief Valerie Steele notes that a fashion exhibition at a museum can produce some hostility, highlighting the low status of fashion within academia, conjuring disagreements between curators and academics, and presenting conflicts about the role of museums and about fashion as an aspect of popular culture. The popularity of sneakers and their role as a mark of distinction among urban youths, like my twelve-year-old self, make them an interesting endeavor for an art museum. The welcoming museum tableau offered this question for the visitor to consider: “How is it that at a single glance, a pair of sneakers can reveal nuanced social information?” The query made me reflect on my adolescent choice to wear a non-gendered sneaker. \n</p>\n<p>In the conclusion to her article, Steele remarks, “[S]ome exhibitions may even be like poems or films, evocative and inspiring even when they are not entirely understood. After all, one of the core constituencies for fashion exhibitions embraces those individuals for whom fashion is a creative field.” While <em>The Rise of Sneaker Culture</em> takes a partial chronological approach, it marks these transitions with six distinct numbered themes: Innovation, Rubber Revolution, The Body Politic, Fashioning Fitness, Sneakers in a Global Society, and Fresh. Neither a poem nor a film, the exhibit is more like a novel, composed of six chapters that tell the story of the sneaker. \n</p>\n<p>Some of my favorites were Chapter 3: The Body Politic, Chapter 5: Sneakers in a Global Society, and Chapter 6: Fresh. The Body Politic addressed the proliferation of sneakers from about post-World War I to the post-World War II baby boom. The museum text panel says that it was in this period that sneakers emerged as one of the most democratic forms of footwear. As people and nations strove for physical fitness, the sneaker’s popularity grew. It was also in this period that two of my favorite brands arose in Germany, Adidas and Puma. By far, the best pair at the exhibit was the Adidas Allround from 1960, merging my love of mid-tops with bright colors and thin soles, in the style of a wrestling shoe. \n</p>\n<p>In Chapter 5: Sneakers in a Global Society, the nostalgia hit me hard. There were my first Jordans, albeit the “real” version, the Adidas Superstars that I wore for my sweet sixteen year, and clips of Run-DMC, talking about their song “My Adidas.” Finally, Chapter 6: Fresh, was by far the most varied in stylings as there were many collaborations of artist and shoe. Most notably, Puma and Kehinde Wiley’s collaboration in 2010 for the Tekkies Mame shoe, with embroidered gold colored fabric, and Puma and Hussein Chalayan’s Urban Swift 2011, where Chalayan’s spiky design makes the shoe look as if the leather is flying off it, from the speed or the wind. And Brooklyn-based artist Shantell Martin made her own fly brand with customized de-branded high-tops from 2012. Puma? Adidas? Nike? Reebok? Who cares! \n</p>\n<p><em>The Rise of Sneaker Culture</em> included all necessary elements of a successful exhibit; visual and aesthetic aspects, historical accuracy, and an interpretation of the concepts presented. Thanks to the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, who organized and curated the exhibit, along with the help of the American Federation of Arts, sneakers went from street chic to discrete feet at the Toledo Museum of Art. \n</p>\n",
