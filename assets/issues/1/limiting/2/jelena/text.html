As I normally wear a base of neutrals with a pop of color, this week was a bit difficult. Masochist that I am, I kept it to no more than two colors to an outfit as well. As I prefer costume jewelry and colorful scarves, I opted out of accessorizing much. I found sticking to a neutral palette kind of a downer though and felt a bit like I was missing something. I guess color in my clothing is really important because I dress pretty simply, especially for an office job.
