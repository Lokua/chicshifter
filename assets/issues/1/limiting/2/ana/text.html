While I regularly wear plenty of neutral colors, I still found this shifter to be interesting as I don’t normally wear a week straight with no color or mix of color. As the tops and bottoms had to be neutral, I broke out a gray wool skirt that I haven’t worn in over a year probably, it was a nice surprise.
