“I am not a fashion designer, I am a clothing designer and I see a huge distinction in that,” says Leigh DeLeonardo, to my initial question about her work as a fashion designer. As I had been using the two words fairly interchangeably, I was intrigued by her response as it forced me to consider my usage which had become automatic, and in many ways empty of meaning. Fashion is transitory, always chasing a trend, forever searching for the new, and a heavily loaded word, according to DeLeonardo. She prefers to create clothing that is timeless, that builds an environment for the wearer, leaving them the freedom to go about the important aspects of their day, while supporting them in these endeavors.

Clarity and rigor are evident not only in DeLeonardo’s discussion of her design, but also in the execution of her creative process. “I’m a firm believer in having a process. I learned that looking at a gigantic task like getting a collection on the racks is extremely stressful. So I break it down into its stages and its steps and I let that guide me through to the end,” says the designer. First, she researches at the Newberry library, leafing through old copies of Vogue or Gazette du Bon Ton, then she sketches, sometimes up to 300 sketches a collection, and from there she iterates until she arrives at a garment that is borne of her efforts, editing down to around 20 favorite pieces.

DeLeonardo creates several collections throughout the year including seasonal transitions, loungewear, dresses, and a linen line, with an average of about nine pieces per collection. Since she is in the position of being both a store owner and clothing designer, she has to wear multiple hats and provide the variety in garments needed for the store. With the help of Jamie LaPorta her partner at Union and knitwear designer, DeLeonardo develops these mini collections to fill any gaps that may exist in the store’s offerings.

She has had the same woven labels bearing her name since the beginnings of her career, from about 1986. In addition to marking her clothes, the Leigh DeLeonardo label acts as an editor for the designer. “This label tells me what I can do in a way, like if I wanted to make a big fun pair of overalls, I couldn’t do it with that label, it just wouldn’t make sense,” she says. DeLeonardo found a way around her editor and created a new label that allows her to create more relaxed, youthful, and simple pieces at a lower price point. Along with LaPorta, they developed the Union brand, to fill a need in the shop, and to challenge DeLeonardo as a designer.

The Union garments are playful, and less refined. A Union bowling shirt for example, in linen, one of the designer’s favorite fabrics, is full of surprises, offering a small sailor collar and pockets. Pockets are not unique to the Union brand, they are part of much of what the designer creates, believing in the utility as well as quality of an item of clothing. While the majority of the Leigh DeLeonardo garments come in solid colors, Union offers a dress and skirt in a gray and black plaid with hints of orange. Although, prints are not limited to the Union label, the spring/summer collection for both labels includes floral based fabrics. Much of the difference between the two labels lies in the detail, and finishing of the garments, anything done with the Leigh DeLeonardo label takes more time than with Union, according to the designer.

Asking a clothing designer if they choose fabric first or decide the shape of the garment is like the chicken and egg question, one cannot exist with out the other, but each designer inevitably has their own method. “My work is about the cut, shape and detail so I need to find fabric that supports these elements.  More recently I've been occasionally starting with the fabric and letting it tell me what to do with it.  I think this is a great way to develop an idea but also it's a bit of a necessity because of how hard it has become to find great fabric.  Sometimes you have to use what you find rather than finding what you need,” she says.  The limiting fabric choices are something that all small-scale designers struggle with and the one thing that DeLeonardo misses from her days of designing for Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue.  But the greater creative freedom and closer relationship with the customer far outweigh any negatives of working independently.

The day we met, Leigh DeLeonardo’s dark shoulder-length hair lay in two braids, and her thick bangs were welcoming and youthful, she wore a linen top of her own design, black trousers and funky yet comfortable Trippen shoes. Like her shoes, DeLeonardo’s designs exude a feeling of coziness, but not in a lazy way, she is concerned about the quality, the fit, the fabric, her customer, and every little detail is contemplated by this American designer. “I come from the place of being a problem solver, my designing is very much inspired by the problems that I’m trying to solve,” says DeLeonardo. Including American designers in our closets is something worthy of attention and action.

While my closet is sadly devoid of any garments bearing the Made in USA label, save for a couple American Apparel garments, DeLeonardo reminds me of the gravity of this whilst discussing the “Limiting Chic” section of Chic Shifter. She suggests a limit of wearing only American-made garments, which I quickly realize would be next to impossible for the majority of Americans. My clothing consumption has been slowly shifting with age and awareness, I choose to buy less on trend and spend more on quality and growth. Both the Union and Leigh DeLeonardo garments seem to me like they could take me through various stages and forms of my future.
