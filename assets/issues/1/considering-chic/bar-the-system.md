# Finding Order Within Fashion’s Disorder
## by Ana Sekler

When I picked up Roland Barthes’ book The Fashion System, I had no idea what type of system to expect. Fashion after all thrives on its unpredictability, its swiftly changing trends, and its lack of definition. How would a literary theorist, philosopher, and linguist like Barthes approach fashion?

Like any good writer, Barthes begins from what he knows of course, in this case a semiotic analysis of clothing as written language as he found consulting issues of Elle and Le Jardin des Modes from June 1958–59. Barthes summarized his endeavor best in an interview with France-Forum from the same year the book was published, 1967:

“My book is an itinerary, a patient, almost meticulous voyage accomplished by an ingenuous man who tries to see how meaning is constructed, how men construct it—in this case, how fashionable clothing is made meaningful: thus, the book becomes a voyage of discovery, a topical itinerary of meaning. And yet this itinerary is presented not as a personal voyage but as a grammar, a description of levels of meaning, of units and their combinatory rules, in short, as a kind of syntax of description. The book will be justified if, being itself a composed object, it manages to evoke before the reader’s eyes, in a kind of homologous fashion, a new object which is clothing in the written mode.”

The majority of the chapters are too technical for the average non-linguist reader to understand or care about, but there are several gems dispersed throughout that are valid in considering contemporary fashion, covering topics not only concerning the co

With each new season, designers are marketing the novel, the fresh and singular items that weren’t there the season before. It becomes even more complicated when today’s fashion introduces not two seasons a year, but eight or even 52 “micro-seasons”. How can fashions change so quickly? The careful observer will note that they do not in fact change as the industry would lead us to believe.

The notion of a rhythm in fashion is introduced by Barthes as he touches upon the work of American cultural anthropologist and father of famed writer, Ursula K. Le Guin.  A.L. Kroeber examined the principles that guided fashion from 1894–1919. The main premise of Kroeber’s work can be summed up by the following: “the rhythm of fashion change is not only regular (the amplitude is about a half century, complete oscillation takes a century) but tends to alternate forms according to a rational order; for example, the breadth of a skirt and that of the waistline are always in inverse relations: when one is narrow, the other is wide. In short, on a time scale of adequate duration, fashion is an orderly phenomenon, and this order comes from within fashion itself.”

According to Barthes, if this rhythm continues to be regular, then skirt length will lengthen from 1967 on and at about 2020 or 2025, skirts should be long again. I found this information fascinating as I do see evidence to corroborate. The midi-length skirt has been a recent hit as far as length and maxi dresses continue to dominate much of the summer wardrobe offerings, so it seems reasonable to postulate that long skirts will be all the rage in five years. Fashion is too often thought of in the span of a few years, but if the range of perception is broadened to thirty or forty years, then a historical continuity is possible.

One of the juiciest attractions to a television series like Downton Abbey is not only the twisting plot lines and character development, but the fashions of a century ago. Contemporary designers took cue and the 2012 lines of Gucci, Ralph Lauren, and Anna Sui evoked the rollicking twenties. The bob haircut is one of the most popular cuts of 2015, another throwback to the previous century.  

The disco-ball has landed in all its metallic glory of fringe, jumpsuits, and high-waists; the 70s returned with a roar in 2014, a span of over thirty years. The sixties influence can already be evidenced in Miu Miu’s most recent collections, patent leather and patterns galore in bright baby-blues, sunshine yellows and Kelly greens.  

Fashion’s changes are not easily reducible to a system as it’s language was for Barthes, but it is important to be aware of the regularity of trends so as not to fall prey to them each time they are marketed as “must-have” or “season’s hottest”. There are plenty of fashion designers who are testing the boundaries of fashion with their cutting-edge designs and truly offering a new idea. I’m reminded of Japanese designers, Anrealage who used photosensitive fabrics in their fall 2015 collection, which changed color when hit by spotlights on the runway, and Belgian fashion designer Iris van Herpen who has been working with 3D printing in her collections.

Changing styles and trends can be overwhelming, with stores receiving new shipments on a weekly, or daily basis at times, the flow appears never ending. Although works like Barthes, and Kroeber may not be from today, the ideas presented are still relevant and worth thinking about in considering fashion consumption and whether or not there is anything innovative in the latest skirt styles.
